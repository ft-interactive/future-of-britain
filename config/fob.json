The company did not have a vote in the referendum and the management team has to carefully consider how it adapts to a Brexit future. In the short term we have made small currency gains on exports, forwards and foreign orders and the crash of the pound has made us more competitive at home and abroad. The next target was intended to be Europe, but that was before Brexit.</p>\n\n<p>The arguments for and against Brexit are well rehearsed, so here let's consider how we cope with its fallout. As an innovative software SME we have to examine what is best for our future: do we continue to focus on expanding abroad or do we decide that the damage done to Britain’s brand by Brexit means we pull up the drawbridge, forget the rest of the world, and expand at home?</p>\n\n<p>One thing is clear: whatever the outcome, uncertainty in the UK trading environment is likely to continue for many years. Two years for a Brexit divorce starting in 2017 will be followed by transitional arrangements leading to permanent trading arrangements by perhaps 2025.</p>\n\n<p>SMEs cannot wait years for trade rules to be established, so we must prepare now for worst case scenarios. We have viewed with dismay the increasingly aggressive stance adopted by the UK towards other countries and do not understand how the government can hope to portray the UK as “open for business” while at the same time putting up barriers to foreigners, foreign direct investment and foreign students and staff. Life isn’t like that.</p>\n\n<p>This stance is damaging to Britain’s brand. Is it so damaging that we should forget exports, enjoy the golf course and concentrate on UK growth? Or should we establish an EU company so that we can compete effectively within Europe, using transfer pricing and maybe even dropping UK branding entirely to remove all association with the negative consequences of Brexit? After all, as a blogger said recently, “that's what multi-nationals do”. Now I understand why.</p>\n\n<p>But Europe is not easy: high taxation and employment legislation, not to mention the appalling exchange rate, mean that any office established there will be expensive in UK terms. Brexit, it seems, will create multiple barriers to our exports. Meanwhile we are expanding and have recently recruited two more European workers in the UK. Altogether we have just four non-UK staff and a few more born outside the UK. Competition for staff in London is tough and we are grateful for everyone who applies. If these staff were not available, which is likely to be the case in future, then our expansion will be curtailed; all the more reason for establishing a substantial and permanent overseas presence. Production capabilities can stay within the UK so that our main costs are counted in sterling, a weak and depreciating currency.</p>\n\n<p>So our future is to build an EU-based operation to enhance growth, to encourage our foreign staff to obtain British citizenship to protect themselves and the company against possible deportation, and to retain our UK base, taking advantage of the relatively low-cost environment. Not the original plan of building a European business from the UK.

The neo-Conservative ideology casts government as the source of everything bad, as in Hayek’s Road to serfdom, and the EU is considered an extra layer of government. This explains why Brexit has emerged politically from the far right, why they claim to love free trade and despise EU bureaucracy.</p>\n\n<p>Yet in a globalising world, government is the only solution to the needs of the crowd. The tax burden on median and lower incomes should not be increased, but on higher incomes it must be, in order to fund infrastructure and the services and safety net that is demanded by the crowd. Progressive property taxation, based on the value of assets, not transactions, is required: it should yield a multiple of the amount it currently raises. Private property lying empty should be penalised. There should be no distinction between domestic and foreign in taxation, the same rule for all. House prices must come down, not crashing down, but the balance needs to be restored over time. There must be root and branch reform of taxation to ensure that widespread tax avoidance cannot continue. Why distinguish income and capital gain? Why offer so many tax reliefs? We should have a bonfire of them. Corporate tax can stay low. It is not the issue. Citizens are the issue.</p>\n \n<p>These are not Conservative policies. But they are not extreme - they follow a Scandinavian model. It is a travesty that the financial crisis of 2007-08 was not recognised as an obvious case of market failure. Instead, the debate was captured by a well-organised pack of neo-Conservative thinkers, blaming government for everything. The referendum vote is the result. That crisis should have brought a change of direction. Let us have it now, but not by making everyone poorer.</p>","pitch":"Theresa May's target is simple: raise median incomes relative to house prices.","goodforinteractiveynm-includeyourinitials":"Y (NS)\nY (LR)","goodforcompetitionynm-includeinitials":"M (NS)\nY (LR)"},{"id":20,"timestamp":"24/10/2016 10:51:48","name":"Juan Pablo Urrutia","location":"London","jobtitle":"European General Counsel","whichchallengeareyouhelpingtosolve":null,"readmore":"<p>The future of the UK is as much irrevocably and permanently intertwined with Europe as Europe's future is intertwined with the UK's. This is why it is not possible to convincingly discuss \"divorces\" that might result in the best relationship the UK could have with the EU or what future the EU will look like post-Brexit.</p>\n \n<p>Europe cannot afford to isolate a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, the 5th largest economy in the world or a nation which sits on the shores of Europe separated only by sliver of muddy water. Equally, the UK cannot turn its back to the very same migration that since the Bronze Age has created these treasured islands that many of us ('native' and of imported vintage) cherish and wish to preserve.</p>\n \n<p>However, as one commentator for this newspaper has already alluded, we are living in 'bizarro' times and this is not limited to fringe parties with insignificant political clout. Lord Hill recently and correctly commented on a BBC interview that the EU was built on romantic ideals of unity. Although Lord Hill was stating the obvious, it seems that many have forgotten (some conveniently through the last four decades of the UK's membership of the EU) that the EU Treaties are built on an ever closer union. Equally, Europeans who argue that the UK needs to face the consequences or abide by paying and accepting all the rules of the club (regardless of how unpalatable the membership conditions are), sound more convincing as a racketeering organisation rather than a political and economic block built on the ideals of ending all wars and violence.</p>\n \n<p>This is the setting in which we must consider what is the best outcome in each case for the UK's departure from the EU and the future of Europe. In neither case is it possible to think that Christmas will come early and the UK and Europe will go in opposite directions singing Kumbaya. The best possible realistic result for the UK and Europe is that the concept of subsidiarity embedded in the EU Treaties will finally be given some teeth by hard-coding (within the EU's structure) the limits of the EU’s supranational decision-making.</p>\n \n<p>Although, seemingly much maligned, the idea proposed by Bruegel of a 'continental partnership' is a step in that direction. Arguably, the concept of ever closer union can be seen as an evolutionary limb just as much as subsidiarity is a mutant gene waiting for the right time to gain momentum. Both concepts of ever closer union and subsidiarity can co-exist in a dynamic evolutionary cycle.</p>\n \n<p>Evolutionary cycles are not alien to the European Parliament and the European Commission and in fact both institutions have thrived on the back of incremental political and economic changes in Europe in the last three decades. The trick now is for policymakers to find the trigger for Europe to change in a way that harnesses Europe's evolutionary gene. Contrarians may argue that the now very probable failure of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement may provide the impetus needed to reform the European institutions to permit a new relation with the UK that is both agreeable and realistic. This observer is more of the view that bees are only ever caught with honey and any positive advance in the pending negotiations with the UK and its exit from the EU would require a more positive framework such as a convincing case for reinvigorating a multiple speed Europe amongst its peoples but, perhaps equally important amongst the perceived self-styled ‘keepers’ of the European Treaties such as the European Commission.</p>","pitch":"We must find the trigger for Europe to change in a way that harnesses its evolutionary gene.","goodforinteractiveynm-includeyourinitials":"Y ajd","goodforcompetitionynm-includeinitials":"Y ajd"},{"id":21,"timestamp":"24/10/2016 09:17:51","name":"Matt Johnson","location":"London","jobtitle":"Finance","whichchallengeareyouhelpingtosolve":null,"readmore":"<p>A significant majority of developed countries in the world are suffering from demographic challenges and high levels of debt.
