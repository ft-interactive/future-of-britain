The company did not have a vote in the referendum and the management team has to carefully consider how it adapts to a Brexit future.  \nIn the short term we have made small currency gains on exports, forwards and foreign orders and the crash of the pound has made us more competitive at home and abroad.  The next target was intended to be Europe, but that was before Brexit.\nThe arguments for and against Brexit are well rehearsed so here let's consider how we cope with its fallout.  As innovative software SME we have to examine what is best for our future: does the company continue to focus on expanding abroad or do we recognise that the damage done to Britain’s brand by Brexit mean that we pull up the drawbridge, forget the rest of the world, and expand at home?  \nOne thing is clear: whatever the outcome; “hard” or “soft” Brexit, uncertainty in the UK trading environment is likely to continue for many years.  Two years for a Brexit divorce starting in 2017 will be followed by transitional arrangements leading to permanent trading arrangements by perhaps 2025.  \nSMEs cannot wait years for trade rules to be established so we prepare now for worst case scenarios.  We have viewed with dismay the increasingly aggressive stance adopted by the UK towards other countries and do not understand how the Government can hope to portray the UK as “open for business” while at the same time putting up barriers to foreigners, foreign direct investment and foreign students and staff.   Life isn’t like that.  \nThis stance is damaging to Britain’s brand.  Is it so damaging that we should forget exports, enjoy the golf course and concentrate on UK growth?  Or should we establish an EU company so that we can compete effectively within Europe, using transfer pricing and maybe even dropping UK branding entirely to remove all association with the negative consequences of Brexit.  After all, as a blogger said recently “that what multi-nationals do”.  Now I understand why. \nBut Europe is not easy: high taxation and employment legislation not to mention the appalling exchange rate mean that any office established there will be expensive in UK terms.  Brexit it seems will create multiple barriers to our exports.\nMeanwhile we are expanding and have recently recruited two more European workers in the UK.  Altogether we have just four non-UK staff and a few more born outside the UK.  Competition for staff in London is tough and we are grateful for everyone who applies.  However our gratitude for their efforts is not mirrored by the Government, though HMRC is only too pleased to accept increased tax and national insurance contributions.   If these staff were not available, which is likely to be the case in future, then our expansion will be curtailed; all the more reason for establishing a substantial and permanent overseas presence.  Meanwhile production capabilities can stay within the UK so that our main costs are counted in sterling, a weak and depreciating currency.\nSo our future is to build an EU based operation to enhance growth.  To encourage our foreign staff to obtain British citizenship to protect themselves and the company against their forced deportation and to retain our UK base, taking advantage of the relatively low cost environment.

We cannot kowtow to the perpetual xenophobes in our society or those who would have us believe that foreigners are anything but a huge benefit to our country across the spectrum. Irrational nationalistic thinking will always be there, but from our NHS to our Universities, from our businesses to politics and culture.  In just about every field of endeavour,  it is proven beyond any reasonable doubt that immigration has been massively beneficial to innovation and capacity and a key driver of progress, economic growth and benefits throughout society. However, we also need to realise that moving from closed doors to open doors suddenly, is likely to lead to rushes or over-rapid adjustment which can cause short term stresses of various sorts. Common sense will tell you communities cannot cope with over-rapid enlargement without having the time and budget to build the requisite infrastructure to accomodate the enlargement. It really is not a matter of closing the door, that is a knee-jerk reaction, but of managing an orderly queue until the rapid adjustment stabilises into a manageable flow. This also means that costs related to infrastructural expansions (in such as schools, hospitals and housing) must be acknowledged as at least partly a cost against the whole community (ie the EU) rather than leaving the recipient country or town to manage on their own. Brexit, to my mind does not mean ditching the four freedoms which are a boon to Britain as they are to Europe. We must however understand and put in place systems of management for over-rapid adjustment in in all the freedoms that could cause short term stress.

However, this uncertainty does not immediately mean that the EU will break all together. Paradoxically, the Brexit is already convincing Europeans that Europe is not the monster that they thought it actually to be. One example is the Netherlands, where support of the “Nexit” actually decreased. \nThe main reason for this is the fact that people are starting to realise that the EU project actually does have advantages. Our current generation of politicians actually do not dare to be honest or open on them, but the populous are starting to realise this. \nThis does not mean that the EU is not without flaws. We need to ensure that the democratic principles are abided to, that rules are made at the appropriate level and that Brussels also answers to the worries that the people of Europe express. It should become a Europe of the people for the people. \nThe fact that Europe needs to become an entity for the people needs first and foremost that it needs to be clear on what its objectives are and what it has achieved. Europe has achieved so much in the form of peace, welfare, wealth and on general progress, that it would be a shame if we lose sight of this. Its objectives should be clear in that it continuous to support these aimes and does actually mike the lives of the people better, not worse. \nIn order to live up to these objectives and corresponding expectations, the EU would need to use Brexit as a force of good. A force of progress. This means that it can take the negotiations and the pain points expressed by the UK and other countries as drivers for change. \nWhat would these changes be? The changes would need to be focused on a number of the critical pain points, which are used by “populists” to move the people and the nations. They can be divided into two types of areas where the EU needs to make changes and provide clarity. The first is economic and the second is social/demographic. They will require adapting treaties, which would be a prerequisite to work. \nFor the economic policies, it would mean that trade stays a clear responsibility of the European Commission, just like setting product standards and other areas that are required to work on in common in light of an internal market. However, it also needs to be clear where these responsibilities stop. \nFor the social/demographic elements, we focus on migration (intra and inter EU) and security. For the first, we need to ensure that there is a common border control. On migration, we need to clearly decide what the role of the EU is and formulate it into the treaty. On the security, there needs to be a focus on information sharing instead of building headquarters. There needs to be a clear benefit in setting up agencies and “services” from Brussels. \nFinally, we see that the freedom of movement is bringing anxiety in a number of countries. This brings me to a clear conclusion that the EU would need to revisit the free movement of people principle. The EU is set-up as a group of countries pooling their economies and where necessary pooling politics. In this case, the free movement does not clearly support this objective.

It is a fitting testament to our fathers that the secession of a member from our great union has resulted in a great debate, not a great civil war.\n\nBut, in a larger sense, we should not assume our fathers’ work is done.  Our freedoms were paid for by the blood of millions who fought and died on the fields of Europe.  The great enemy they defeated was an idea; the idea that some men are better than other men born elsewhere.  This enemy is once more present in much of our great debate, and in the arguments made by secessionists who challenge our great union.\n\nLet us however acknowledge that our union is not perfect.  Today our union falls short of the great ideal that someone who, fighting a war for equality amongst men against secessionists, declared to be “government of the people, by the people, for the people”.  And it is in the second part of that ideal that we fall short.  Let us be frank; the European Commission is an affront to this ideal.\n\nOur union is based on four freedoms; free movement of goods, capital, services and above all, free movement of people.  Only with that last freedom can we ensure that, through knowledge and understanding of one another, we never again lay our continent to ruin.  Today our freedoms are under threat; we must defend them.  It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. Shall we defend them through a closer union?

The Parliament and Council should then decide which existing directives should be repealed.\n•\tForm a framework for state bankruptcies.  States should be allowed to declare bankruptcy without losing access to the ECB for their banks, or access to the EU.  This simple mechanism would do away with most issues currently blighting the euro – the Stability & Growth Pact could immediately be rescinded.

There is no studies or any research that can confirm immigration “harm” British chance to have a jobs. And losing global talents around the world as a financial capital? The cost is too high. Second is about international student. Why are they included in the calculation? They come here to study and only allow to work part time, and if the government want, they can just ban out like the US.

Therefore, we have set out a process of phased separation and recovery.\n\nIn all, we identify six phases. The first deals with the legal process of withdrawing from the EU, with the aim of concluding an agreement within the initial two year period allowed by Article 50. In this, we seek continued participation in the EU's Single Market. \n\nThe six phases involve both short-term and longer-term negotiations, to achieve a measured, progressive separation. In the first phase, there are three possible options. One is by rejoining EFTA and trading with the remaining EU member states through the EEA – the so-called Norway Option. Another is the \"shadow EEA\" and the third we call the \"Australian process\".\n\nAs part of the first phase, we would repatriate the entire body of EU law applicable to the UK, including that pertaining to agriculture and fisheries, buying time for a more considered review of the UK statute book. \n\nWe would continue co-operation and co-ordination with the EU at political and administrative levels, where immediate separation of shared functions is neither possible nor desirable in the short term. \n\nThese would include the framework research programme (Horizon 2020), the Single European Sky and the European Space Programme, certain police and criminal justice measures, joint customs operations, third country sanitary and phytosanitary controls, anti-dumping measures, and maritime surveillance. \n\nThus, the first phase is limited to an economically neutral transition. It lays the foundations for the UK to exploit its independence, without trying to achieve everything at once. The basic withdrawal framework could be in place within two years of starting negotiations.\n\nEven before exit, we would initiate a second phase – the regularisation of our immigration policy and controls. This will include activating Article 112 of the EEA Agreement, and action at a global level to deal with the 1951 Geneva Convention and the 1967 Protocol, as well as modifying or withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nWe then propose a third phase, building a genuine, Europe-wide single market, with common decision-making for all parties. This will be fully integrated into the global rule-making process, through existing international bodies. \n\nThe aim is a community of equals in a \"European village\", rather than a Europe of concentric circles, using the Geneva-based United Nations Economic Community Europe (UNECE). Thus, the exit from the EU becomes the start of an ongoing process, the means to an end, not the end itself. \n\nSimultaneously, we identify and explore some key areas where independent policy development is required. In phase four, we make a start on this, the work eventually leading to divergence from the EU and the emergence of unique UK policies.\n\nPhase five comprises a coherent programme to define our global trading relations. This comprises eight separate initiatives. \n\nSixth, and finally, we embark on a series of domestic reforms, by introducing elements of direct democracy and the other changes embodied in The Harrogate Agenda – the immediate aim being to prevent ever again a situation where our Parliament hands over our powers to an alien entity without the permission of the people.\n\nIn its totality – the sum of the parts being greater than the whole - we call our exit plan Flexcit, standing for a flexible response and continuous development. This market solution to leaving the EU is a process, not an event. It provides a template for the next twenty or so years of our national development.","pitch":"Flexcit"},{"id":51,"readmore":"Immigration has both negative and positive effects. The greater the number of new low skilled migrants to the UK, the more negative the effect on low skilled wages is, with the bottom 40% of the UK receiving no wage increases for 12-15 years. With little knowledge where or how much to target public funds for infrastructure investment, due to the EU's free movement principle, public resources become stretched and prices increase if the demand exceeds available supply, hence why house prices in specific localities have rocketed, and specific areas of public infrastructure have become stretched. \n\nBritish workers also become demotivated by the decrease in living standards and turn to greater welfare. It is not the migrant who \"takes\" from the Government, but their effect on the economy that forces non-migrants to turn to the Government that is a much larger issue. This issue includes the phenomena of \"qualification inflation\", whereby jobs previously not requiring degrees now need them, adding greater cost to the economy in the form of student debt. This issue ranges from teaching through to nursing, policing, and others that are included in the \"2m high skilled jobs\" that the Government say it created in the wake of the 1.1m British workers previously in low skilled labour positions that were replaced by cheaper EU migrants. \n\nYet, the converse is true for high skilled immigration. High skilled migrants fill skills gaps, increase wages and productivity, are more educated, wealthier in general, and usually understand the English language. With the high skilled human talent pool shifting from the EU to non-EU areas of the world, as the EU's share (ex. UK) of Global GDP declines to below 10% by 2030, the UK should adopt a more global immigration strategy whilst protecting those at the bottom of the economic ladder. It will help to stimulate innovation and productivity, while reducing inequality as the available supply of low skilled labour diminishes - pushing up wages, as companies are forced to turn to new technologies and innovative concepts to reduce their low skilled labour costs.\n\nThis should have the prerequisites that a) protects low skilled labour and b) makes the UK more innovative, competitive, productive, and wealthier on a per capita basis. While it might not be obvious to some how both objectives can be achieved, it was the lack of low skilled labour that made Britain have the highest wages in the world that forced industrialists to create the new technological innovation that caused the industrial revolution in the 1700s (combined with cheap / accessible energy supplies in the form of coal). \n\nMy proposal is to allow free movement above certain salary thresholds in specific regions - lets call it the Local Migrant Minimum Salary.\n\nThe UK already does this nationally for non-EU workers at £35,000, and expanding this to EU workers if Britain leaves the Single Market would be a simple matter of scaling. Rather than the Government assessing who is or is not \"high skilled\", visas would be automatically approved (with oversight from a new independent regulatory body) if the job is over the LMMS, subject to criminal checks, itself set by regional authorities, avoiding the bureaucracy about who is or is not high skilled.\n\nThe LMMS would be decided by each Council. For example, London and Scotland might decide to set the LMMS to £0, meaning any London employer could recruit anyone, whereas Leeds or Surrey might set it at £35,000. Each area would compete against each other, but also decide how much low skilled labour they need and the resources they have available to insure minimal impact on existing workers. The UK would make exceptions for vital sectors that pay lower as a whole but locals are not able to fill. \n\nThe Local Migrant Minimum Salary would help resolve constitutional issues, economic inequality, and make the economy more productive by making UK immigration policy more global, yet locally determined, and focused on high skilled migration.","pitch":"Free movement above salary thresholds, themselves set by local authorities"},{"id":52,"readmore":"I assume a \"Soft Brexit\" could be the most beneficial route for the UK; exit from EU is inevitable in order to preserve the rights of people who voted LEAVE and to clarify the UK lives in a democracy, therefore respecting the will of the population.\nAt present small businesses rely on tight margins, so I expect an increase in bureaucracy will increase fixed costs, therefore a higher chance of default, leading to job losses, less corporation and personal taxes paid to the Government and possibly a house crisis (mortgage default). The next step would then be to save the banks from a cash shortage.\n\nMy solution: a deal with EU in order to maintain the \"Free Passport\" right for the financial services; in exchange products entering and exiting the UK could be taxed a flat fee (5-10%).\nAt the same time people would be allowed to free movement all around Europe for the purpose of travelling, studying, holiday, business and family matters, residency with means of self support; in order to look for a job and working the person would need a permit, which is given automatically and ceases only when the person reaches 6 or more months of unemployment in a calendar year (the council where the person resides can stamp the permit every 12 months as long as the EU citizen shows his/her employment records).\n\nReason to follow this route: all EU citizens will be then obliged to work and show their income, therefore this will automatically reduce the cash in hand salaries, leading to more corporation and personal taxes paid to the Government and reducing the amount of benefit paid to job seekers.  \n\nKind regards,\nFabrizio Di Gianvincenzo","pitch":"We need allies to prosper in a connected world."},{"id":53,"readmore":"The people voted only to leave the EU.

Before we move into what this statement means I would like to refer to what the current Europe is and how I say it moving into the future.  The Europe of today is a combination of various societies with different cultures and languages.\n\nHowever, in the last 40 years we have seen a major increase in the interaction between European societies. Before the beginning of this 40 year period travelling within Europe was very sporadic and usually limited to wealthy individuals or those in government or business. Now, Europeans travelling around Europe has become an ordinary matter, whether it is for holidays, study or business, thanks to improved transport facilities and their more accessible costs.  Even more, we now see a fast-increasing new trend: those that move to another corner of Europe on a long term or permanent basis, some to build a new life, others on retirement.  Similarly, technology advances in communications (radio first, then TV, now Internet and other digital communications channels like messaging services) are pushing for an increased sharing and merging of previously separated and, up to a point, different cultures.  A new unifying common culture is growing in Europe where we share common life experiences: music, literature, food, ideas, etc.  Finally, while in the past language was a barrier and the knowledge of another European language was limited to those who lived close to another language speaking region, wealthy individuals or economic migrants, nowadays many Europeans speak more than one language, often using English as a commonly acceptable lingua franca.\n\nThis integration is happening because of the will of the Europeans. The natural human desire to discover and enjoy new experiences tied with Europe’s closed proximity, physically and ideologically, and the advance of technologies that encourage and facilitate contacts between us.\n\nWhile the EU has developed certain programmes that have facilitated this integration, such as university exchange programs and EU wide regulations allowing the movement of individuals, the fact is that, other than those EU-led initiatives, this integration has occurred with very limited assistance, if any, from individual EU Member Estates governments.  It feels like the governments refuse to see what is happening or have not warmed to the idea of a socially and culturally integrated Europe.\n\nIn summary, this fast-moving process of integration is upon us and we all must embraced it, not because it is inevitable but because of the benefits that will bring this and future generations of Europeans.  This includes the governments of the EU Member Estates, which must wake up from their sleep and consider very carefully their next steps.  They can join this social movement.  Or be left behind, isolated from other fellow governments and the new Europe but, more importantly, from their own citizenship, part of which (and with increasing numbers) has already accepted and is enjoying the benefits of such integration.\n\nIn summary, close governments and countries are becoming obsolete.  They do not fit the new Europe.  In order to adapt and survive they must learn to open their borders, loosen their controls and rules, and give up their powers, for eventually to merge into one single entity to match the new single social reality.

The EU faces its gravest existential crisis in nearly 50 years with an economy moving in southern Europe at a glacial pace; a banking system not yet fully recovered nor pooled at Eurozone level; new movements turning back the clock of social liberalism in central and Eastern Europe; and the collapse of states in the Middle East near our own frontiers with millions of refugees seeking sanctuary in Europe.\n\nBeyond the short-term politics, it is in the interests of both the UK and the EU to reach a durable partnership agreement that reflects the majority of the British people’s desire to leave the EU, but recognises the strong economic, social, and historic links between the Union and the second largest economy in the continent. \n\nThe UK has ruled out existing models for a new long-term relationship between the UK and EU. Designing an alternative that meets the interests of exporters across the EU in avoiding the grim consequences of 5-14% rises in trading costs through the UK leaving the customs union, and providing maximum market access for financial services in the UK to the EU, as well as EU access to UK capital markets, will require flexibility and imagination. In doing so, both sides will need to compromise on sovereignty. \n\nIf UK firms are cut out of the Single Market for banking and payment services, relying on an equivalence principle in some, but not all Directives or sectors, financial services, contributing some £66bn in UK tax revenues, and 12% of UK exports annually, face an uncertain future. The best means of producing certainty would be for the UK to seek from the outset some transitional measures to keep services within the Single Market until a long-term trade agreement can be reached. What Canada achieved with the EU over 7 years, the UK will be attempting to secure and more in around 1 year plus time to ratify the deal. A tall order. CETA has very little access to European services markets for Canadian companies – a UK-EU trade agreement will require more ambitious outcomes.\n\nWe can find the basis of a solution between the UK and the EU within CETA, which creates joint bodies to administer the agreement, approximate laws between the two jurisdictions, and a tribunal to deal with disputes. \n\nWe must be clear what that means – no jurisdiction for the European Court of Justice, no application of EU Law, reform to the free movement of workers as it applies to the UK. If accompanied by generous guaranteed reciprocal access between the UK and EU-27 labour markets, even if regulated by work permits, and non-discriminatory treatment of each others’ citizens, and an acceptance that the benefits of the customs union for both parties outweighs any speculative gains from future trade agreements, these could meet the aims of both sides. Such a deal could also deal with joint co-operation between the UK and EU on science, higher education, innovation, intellectual property, medicines, and research policies assuaging the concerns that have existed in these sectors since June.\n\nIt is also important to face facts – a comprehensive trade agreement of this sort requires the pooling of sovereignty. The de facto standards set in international trade deals are made by just three global actors – the US, EU and China. \n\nPrevious generations responded to great challenges with boldness, innovation and creativity. The EU and UK can act decisively with those purposes over the next few years, and set a new direction that can heal our continent.","pitch":"UK/EU can reach trade, co-operation and investment partnership agreement for mutual benefit of both"},{"id":57,"readmore":"If Britain is to prosper post-Brexit, it is imperative that she remains competitive and an attractive destination for foreign talent and investment. I propose three desiderata.\n\nOne, Britain must run a budget surplus. As the Singaporean and Greek examples demonstrate, a budget surplus is instrumental to economic and political independence. This is not to be achieved through clumsy and pound-foolish Osbornesque austerity, but through a fundamental rethink of how money is spent. The time is nigh to slaughter some of Britain’s sacred cows. The NHS is stretched to breaking point and is behind continental systems in respect of cost savings and quality. Consider placing healthcare on an insurance footing, albeit with state supervision and subsidies where warranted. Emotional attachment to the NHS must give way to economic reality.\n\nCurrent methods of dispensing benefits and associated costs are intolerably expensive. The government ought to consider abolishing some categories of benefits altogether, and scale back futile and uneconomic efforts to combat benefit fraud. Focus should shift to providing high quality re-education and vocational training, particularly for disillusioned workers and young people from deprived backgrounds.\n\nTwo, Britain must invest aggressively. Key areas such as transport, education, and manufacturing suffer from chronic underinvestment and neglect. The government must not relegate itself to the backseat by assuming a purely regulatory role, but must instead pro-actively lead investment. Inadequate transport infrastructure invariably mean that wealth creation will concentrate in the South, reducing the Northern Powerhouse to a pipe dream, and exacerbating the risk of the UK breaking up. 21st century Britain needs 21st century transport solutions, and HS2 is too little, too late. What Britain needs is a consolidation of rail companies in the mould of JR, and dedicated high speed passenger rail that can whisk one from London to Edinburgh in two hours, in effect a British Shinkansen that will serve as the backbone of the country.\n\nBritain must also spend money to further develop and protect its high end manufacturing and research sectors. It must protect nascent industries and shield competitive firms from foreign takeovers. I have in mind Softbank’s recent acquisition of ARM amongst other things. It is not coincidental that Germany and Japan, both with strong manufacturing sectors and numerous industry champions, consistently enjoy a balance of payments surplus, whereas Britain languishes from an unsustainable BOP deficit. Whilst the City’s importance cannot be understated, an economy wholly reliant on financial services, tourism, and higher education is extremely vulnerable to the vagaries of the free market and more tangible external threats.\n \nThree, Britain must leave its doors open to immigrants. The contributions of skilled foreigners to healthcare, technology, and finance, and unskilled foreigners to agriculture and construction cannot be highlighted enough. For Britain to be competitive, it must be thoroughly meritocratic; it must always have the best minds, regardless of creed or nationality. Given the challenges that Britain will face in the future, second best is not going to cut it. It follows that the talent pool cannot be confined to locals and Europeans.\n\nUnfortunately, the visa system in Britain for third-party nationals is intolerably convoluted, restrictive, and bureaucratic. It fails to identify worthy applicants who can contribute genuinely. Much has to be done as well to tackle the toxic political climate of recent months, wherein it has become acceptable to demonise and single out foreign residents.\n \nThese propositions are predictably politically costly and unpalatable, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Unless Britain is content with exporting jams, it must change; in fact, as a resource-poor island nation, not unlike Singapore or Japan, it must spearhead change.","pitch":"Britain On The Offensive"},{"id":58,"readmore":"\"Alea iacta est\" were the first words through my mind when I first grabbed my phone on the morning of the 24th of June and read through bleary eyes that the UK had narrowly voted to leave the European Union.

Julius Caesar helped create a European land empire that still shapes many of the borders of modern Europe. Yet it is ironic that some two thousand later many Britons still apparently see any European liaison as a yoke to be thrown off.\n\nAncestral Britons fought in 55 BC against the foreign power of Rome, and against many others in the subsequent millennia. Somehow, in 2016 AD the imagery was much the same: the need to fend of the unnatural power of the oppressive regime in Brussels. \n\nFreedom! Control! Beef and Liberty!

The Patriotic Briton had the duty to be brave and choose the deep blue sea, not the European devil and its strange, continental – and whisper it – dictatorial ways.\n\nBut the European Union is not a Superstate. It is not perfect, certainly. It has its democratic deficits. Its economic policies are incomplete. Its politics is laborious and gaff-prone. But the EU is not the society-crushing monster of Brexiteer lore. \n\nInstead, the EU is an attempt by countries who have known the loneliness of utter ruin to pool sovereignty in order to extract some stability and influence in a world full of very actual monsters. \n\nThe democracy that cast the die is becoming the tyranny of the majority the EU was meant to protect against. Brexit is proceeding down a path that very few of the players in the game anticipated or intended.\n\nThus we must be brave. There has been a rush to accept the result because to deny it is to seem to deny the democratic legitimacy of the vote. However, there is no democratic mandate derived from a vote where one group’s assertions have since proven to be falsehoods. They cast a weighted die. \n\nHushed has been the voice that could ask, “Can we accept a result based on false premises? Is Brexit what we really want for our society?

Uncertainty is also in Europe, countries like Sweden could see a large drop in exports, as Sweden’s exports to the United Kingdom amounted to $9.8 billion or 7% of its overall exports. We are in just behind Germany who have 7.3% , and it is not just Sweden, the sherry manufacturers in Spain have estimated that their sales could fall by as much at 15%.\n\nI have just returned from The Netherlands, again very concerned as they export 9.5% to the UK. France and Germany again about 7% of their exports.

The question is, with stagnant EU growth, could they really afford to? You cannot keep members in a club by using threats.\n\nSomething that has not reared its head yet  is the UK’s binding requirements to the EU budget for the next 2- 3 years. This amounts to at least £20 billion.

One need only correlate regions that voted Leave with relative economic prosperity to draw a stark conclusion – many of those at the lower end of the income/wealth scale voted to exit the EU.

It could be said there is no greater vindication for a disenchanted voter than seeing the symbol of their problems unceremoniously usurped – a fate bestowed upon David Cameron.

Much of modern life is great, but it sure is easy to fall by the wayside if lacking in purpose, relevant skills and inspiration. It is apparent many such folk channelled this into their voting behaviour. Theresa May is acutely aware of this – seeking to govern “for the many not the few.”\n\nIt could be said that all roads lead to peace. Every supposedly self-destructive action is undertaken to achieve a higher state of mind. Why do we binge on drugs, drink or sugar? To escape our perceived problems, bringing about a temporary respite and hence happiness, regardless of the dissuasive scientific evidence of the long term ramifications and negative societal externalities. At the extreme, some totally disenfranchised young men join a death cult masquerading as a ‘political movement’, finding vindication in spreading fear via callous murder, mutilation and abuse. All they ever wanted was to be accepted and respected – and hence achieve inner calm.\n\nIn the era of rising automation, artificial intelligence and subsequent possible labour market dislocation, foreseeing potentially almighty social disunity is straightforward. That is, unless a transition is made to a society in which man and machine can effectively and peacefully coexist.

All stand to benefit from innovative thinking – no matter how wealthy, the risks posed by mass outrage are all too apparent.\n\nIf we are to thrive in a world of change, complexity and competition, then it stands to reason that creativity, resilience and dynamism must be nurtured.

At the issue’s crux, stiflingly unsustainable living and business practices can make way for more productive and fulfilling ones, especially those with positive externalities.

We are seeing an increase in negatively framed schools of thought across Europe and the World.\n\nBritain suffers an ageing infrastructure, a woeful lack of new affordable homes, and a terrible corporate tax policy. All are stifling our economic growth, and disillusioning many of the young in our country. Rectifying these makes up the core of my article.\n\nMuch of what we hold dear is being privatised (NHS, train services, probation services), with catastrophic consequences in cost of use, and effective running... (think Southern Rail, continual NHS cuts to budget...) The trains are a horrendous example of commuters held over a barrel, and prices going up as much as 6% on year – well over inflation figures and wage growth.\n\nPrivatisation has its place in society, but when core human needs are at stake the government should look for a best of breed to provide these services. We already pay high tax compared to the US and some European countries, but with a continued reduction in service standards, we reach parity or worse with these countries.\n\nWe must tax the corporate entities fairly to re-balance the books and fund infrastructure growth, healthcare improvement, educational reform, and make Britain a functioning, fair society. This has to be a global effort – one started by the EU, but we must mimic any efforts made to bring tax collection into a fairer, more egalitarian system. We must move away from the 99% vs the 1%, by ring fencing this improved tax policy for further investment in the country that benefits EVERYONE. \n\nInfrastructure should be a wholly public affair. This includes road and rail, emergency provision (health, police, fire etc.) The continued development in these will allow Britain to maintain and grow its global standing. As our population globally continues to grow exponentially we must be able to transport around human resource effectively – to position our skills where they are needed.\n\nScience investment is the only way for Britain to maintain its world status. Despite Brexit we must enshrine Britain as a knowledge pool worth investing in, and provide meaningful advancement, through greater public investment in research. This should be done through the additional corporation taxation of offenders of poor corporate practices. In turn reduce the cost of corporation tax where business improves scientific progression or philanthropic objectives - that have a direct impact on both Britain, and humanity as a whole. (For example carbon neutral have greater tax incentives, brown belt housing developers the same.) The objective is to have a tax system that rewards forward thinking companies and punishes backwards thinking companies – thus attracting the behaviours of positive contributors. \n\nWe are on the precipice of another banking crisis, we have to punish diligently any failure to protect against this. 2008 saw only one banker brought to justice - the people responsible for that crash, and the next crash must be held accountable for the increase in social inequality felt across the world. Only then will we see behavioural change.\n\nPeople crave something positive to believe in, to set their morals against, and to motivate to achieve great things in life. The resurgence of hard nationalism, and extremism is a loss of a common and uniting positive cause. We should look to battle the effects of climate change as a global entity, and Britain should lead this endeavour.

Ireland attempted to act unilaterally in 'full sovereignty' when it guaranteed all banking liabilities and ended up in a Trokia bailout.

On exiting the EU, Britain must reach a deal with the EU that hinders trade as little as possible. It must make a deal that allows the relative easy movement of skilled labour throughout Europe. Both of these elements will help retain Britain's standing as a great trading nation and as a nation in which to make investment. In a nutshell Britain should seek a soft 'Brexit'. A hard 'Brexit' benefits no one, least of all Great Britain.","pitch":"Britan needs to opt for a soft 'Brexit' for it's own benefit."},{"id":100,"readmore":"It would be useful if the British government could say one positive thing about the European Union or other European nations and peoples. Unfortunately Britain has generally always been critical of the EU, for ever carping at the sidelines, and its relationship has often been laced with condescension. While I am not a specialist, I cannot think of a single positive thing which a British government has ever said about Britain's continental neighbors. Russell Frederick Bretherton's concluding remarks at the Messina Conference in 1955 may have been apocryphal: \"Gentleman, you are trying to negotiate something you will never be able to negotiate. But, if negotiated, it will not be ratified. And if ratified, it will not work. Au revoir et bonne chance\". But they well summarize the spirit of Britain's relationship with the EU ever since. Very few politicians or public figures have struck a different approach: Eddie Izzard is a notable exception!\n\nA good place to start would be to give a unilateral guarantee of peace and security for EU residents who are already living in the UK, especially those living there for some time. There could be some cut-off date, say when Britain finally leaves the EU in spring 2019, or a before, and perhaps some minimum period of residence. But a cast-iron guarantee would be good politics and good economics as it would indicate to EU residents in the UK that their participation in society is welcomed and their stake in British society protected. It would be a good move more generally in terms of human rights too.","pitch":"A cast-iron guarantee for long-term EU residents in the UK"},{"id":101,"readmore":"It is undeniable that a swathe of the UK electorate is expressing discontent at the rate of immigration since the turn of the century. In the year to xxx 2016 this was a net 330,000. This is vastly above the Government’s stated target of 100,000, but is that figure appropriate?\n\nThe most common question surrounding this topic tends to be, ‘what scale of net immigration is preferable for the UK?’ The answer to this is clearly not some arbitrary metric but  the number of people by which the UK can increase its population while expanding and, crucially, funding its infrastructure and public services appropriately.\n\nMost people only care about a few things: their access to healthcare, their children’s education and their ability to attain a comfortable home to raise their family. Unfortunately the immigration rate in recent years has vastly outpaced the expansion of infrastructure and so voters have seen their standard of living diminish. This more than anything is what led to the Brexit result.\n\nAn example of how much infrastructural investment is needed each year to support current levels of net immigration is offered by Cardiff, the population of which is 315,000 and a good proxy for the net annual immigration figure. Cardiff has 5 hospitals, 90 GP surgeries, 140 schools and 150,000 houses. Of course, on top of this we would need the thousands of teachers, doctors and nurses to staff these shiny new buildings. Where we would find these people is a whole separate issue.\n\nThe above is merely that which would be necessary each year to avoid deterioration from the current position and, given the doctor and teacher strikes of the last few years, this position is already sub-standard.\n\nThe traditional response of government to most problems is one of  planning and investment. Unfortunately, therein lies the crux of the problem with free movement; planning is impossible on account of the fact that it is unknown in what magnitude, and more importantly, in what location, immigration will occur. Nor is it currently clear  where the savings would be made to allow this additional investment.\n\nIt is important but not sufficient to ensure that the UK continues to bring in migrants that contribute economically via their skills which businesses vitally need. However, as of 2012 it is estimated that a person must be earning at least £30,000 before they make a net fiscal contribution to the economy. Therefore, with the exception of seasonal workers who do not intend to settle, this amount should be considered the earnings threshold for foreign employees. \n\nBusinesses should be allowed to fill their skills gaps, according to the earnings threshold and with independence on nationality, ensuring no preferential treatment of EU over non-EU citizens. \n\nMost importantly, devolution of taxes and local investment decisions needs to occur. Then economic benefits gained via productive immigration could be fed back into the local area to improve and expand infrastructure, so the whole community felt richer rather than poorer. \n\nStudent visas should continue to be considered separately, and be unlimited for highly regarded universities in order to attract the world’s brightest, although upon completion the individual would need to satisfy the earnings criteria to remain.\n\nThe current system has left some communities overwhelmed with a sense of abandonment with the beneficiaries usually being large corporate shareholders. The balance needs to be shifted so those communities can also benefit from the economic prosperity that occurs when skilled migrants join their towns and cities.","pitch":"Infrastructure and community inclusion is the key to immigration policy"},{"id":102,"readmore":"Britain has little choice about the post-Brexit arrangements, since the terms are likely to be dictated not by Whitehall but by Brussels.

What he is also admitting - à son insu - is that the Union is held together only by fear. He might as well write its epitaph.\n \nMr Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel invariably fall back on the four freedoms - movement, goods, services, and capital - enshrined in EU treaty law, as if they were sacrosanct.\n \nThese freedoms are nothing but pious shibboleths. They often do not exist, and where they do exist they are routinely honoured in the breach. Services make up 70% of the EU economy yet account for just 22% of internal EU trade. All attempts to open services up to cross-border commerce have been defeated, to the detriment of Britain.\n  \nThe 'country of origin rule' that would have allowed firms to operate anywhere in the EU under their own domestic law was dropped, casualty of the \"Polish plumber\" scare. The directive did not cover health care, transport, legal services, professions, tax experts, and the like. Germany protected its guilds.\n \nOnline and digital trade across borders remains minimal, riddled with barriers. Britain's All-Party Parliamentary Group for European Reform concluded that \"there is no single market in services in any meaningful sense.\"\n\nRemember the parallel fiasco of the takeover directive. This too was sabotaged by France and Germany, after fourteen wasted years. They reinstated poison pills and a host of tricks in an explicit attempt to stop 'Anglo-Saxon predators' taking over their companies, even as their own companies were free to stalk British prey.\n\nSo much for the freedoms of capital and services. Nor has the free movement of people been strictly upheld. France and Germany - unlike Britain - blocked access to their labour markets and welfare systems for East Europeans for seven years after they joined the EU in 2004. It was political decision.\n\nThe four freedoms are really just aspirational guidelines, enforced when expedient, neglected at other times. The rigid exhortations from Paris, Berlin, and Brussels that there can be no free trade with Britain unless there is unrestricted migration - even after leaving the EU - is politics masquerading as principle.

But a  decision can only be taken by the government and Parliament about something so fundamental as this country’s membership in one of the most successful and largest international organisations that history has ever seen. If one must always turn to Winston Churchill in this country for inspiration, then do so by commemorating his efforts to help the world out of successive battle and into a new era of co-operation, prosperity and peace which he did by working at Bretton Woods with his peers in the Western Alliance. The free movement of goods, services, capital and people was new at the time and its absence was the tool that helped to enable the previous dictatorships to create the catastrophe of the two world wars and other failures such as the Great Depression. Co-operation and the four freedoms are at the heart of the world trading system. Co-operation between nations happens by way of Treaties which need parliamentary ratification to become binding on the people.

The economy of the future is a mixed one, neither privatised nor socialised, but with the private-public boundary determined by pragmatic rather than ideological criteria.\n\nThe severe (and rapidly worsening) current account deficit is the metric which lays bare the failure of the model. Inward capital flows exceeding £100bn are required just to sustain the British standard of living, and the returns on each such inflow worsen future deficits. This can become a downward spiral, to which going cap-in-hand to China is no solution. The need for wholesale reform is surely self-evident.\n\nExport improvement can be based only on quality, not price. The notion that a developed economy can ever compete on price is a fallacy. Switzerland does not have cheaper wages than the Sudan. Producing in Germany can never be as cheap as in Ghana. Germany and Switzerland compete on quality, not price.

On the one hand success in today's Global economy requires extensive international networks of ideas and people that are key to creating new economic opportunities.  Growth of the UK economy can best be encouraged by allowing friction-free movement of students, academics, and skilled knowledge workers to the UK. This freedom of movement has helped make Britain, and London in particular, one of a handful of leading centres in the World for Global value creation.   However, at the same time, free movement of low and semi-skilled workers, particularly from Eastern Europe has created excessive competition for low paid jobs in the UK.  This has enabled employers to increasingly undermine terms and conditions of low paid employees, and  added to a growing crisis for many UK citizens unable to achieve a living wage in the increasingly competitive Global economy.\n\nUnfortunately most of the potential solutions to this conflict of UK interest all have very serious drawbacks.  Either they will either not be acceptable to UK citizens, or will seriously disadvantage UK businesses and academic research.   Any restrictions on movement which result in loss of UK citizens' rights to work or live throughout the EU will be deeply unpopular with a cross-section of British voters who have come to view this freedom as a fundamental right.  Yet to place any restrictions on foreign workers which are not reciprocal will never be accepted by the EU.\n\nWith no workable solutions for rule-based access our only real option is to use market-based incentives that will allow the UK government, and others around the EU, to lean against the rise in demand for immigrant workers when necessary.   For the UK this would mean applying a new National Insurance surcharge on UK  based employers for any non-UK citizen on their payroll (for say 10% of wages).  This would not amount to pay discrimination as both immigrants and UK citizens would receive the same pay for doing the same job.  However, the increased cost to employers of using immigrant labour would encourage them to employ and train UK citizens first, and only actively seek to actively recruit immigrants where suitable UK workers are not available.\n\nSome key advantages of this system are :\n\nFree movement rights are maintained, but companies encouraged to hire national citizens\nHigh-skilled roles largely unaffected as premium on employers' costs unlikely to be critical\nPublic services roles (including NHS) unaffected as surcharge would be budget neutral\nRevenue raised from private companies' NI payments could be used to invest in UK communities that still receive large numbers of immigrants.  This would ensure that housing, education and other public services are adequately resourced to cope with increased demands, and provide spending to ensure proper integration such as free language classes. \n\nNo doubt some human rights campaigners will still argue this system is still unfair, because it discriminates between nationalities in job recruitment.  But this is, after all the point of Brexit, to make UK citizens feel that their economic opportunities are placed ahead of those of foreigners.  Meanwhile, it still preserves the rights of freedom of movement which are essential to the future growth of the UK economy post Brexit.

Both cases have created an unprecedented intensity of public debate, and the US case prompted a revision of the country’s institutional framework, which could potentially be the case for Brexit as well.\n\nIn the US, the crisis led to the ‘federalist papers’, a detailed commentary on the principles underlying the American federation. The countervailing arguments, the ‘anti-federalist papers’, postulated risks to the freedoms gained during the revolutionary war and led to the drafting of the US Bill of Rights (amendments to the US constitution).  \n\nIn the EU, the Brexit crisis is the culmination of a longstanding British (but also Swiss and Scandinavian) discomfort with European integration, its institutionalisation, and the purpose of the free movement of labour. Its countervailing arguments, beyond the obvious economic inter-dependence of European states, still need to be fleshed out, but one can imagine their basic tenets. In essence, they would reaffirm the geopolitical interdependence of European states in the midst of multiple global crises, as well as clarify and deepen the criteria for differing levels of EU membership (‘variable geometry’). Put together with the concomitant and legitimate demand for greater democratic control on the nature and pace of integration, this could lead to the drafting of a ‘European Bill of Rights’. \n\nA ‘European Bill of Rights’ might be the way forward, not only to surpass the Brexit referendum impasse, but also to give greater representation for EFTA states as well as settling the definitive architectural pillars and geographic reach of the EU. \n\nFirst and foremost, the document could clearly and succinctly specify different levels of rights and obligations for EU citizens thus changing the negative and overwhelmingly economic nature of the Brexit public debate. The first level of integration (the present single market) would include the rights to visa-free travel, residency, public education, health systems, limited roaming charges, EU public investment, etc. as well as the associated obligations of EU Commission oversight, ECJ final rulings and budgetary contributions to the EU.  It would also reaffirm the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. \n\nThis first level of integration would establish limits to the freedom of movement of labour. The logical path would be to create an option for time-limited emergency brakes for new work permits when a significant wave of intra-EU migration occurs, using this period to increase investment in public services in the affected areas while limiting access to the single market. Candidate states to the EU could also be limited to this first level of integration, with total freedom of movement of labour only activated once equivalent levels of economic development were reached. \n\nThis first level, a form of revised and expanded EEA, would not require any further integration but would have its own representation, with a distinct format of Council meetings and Parliamentary sessions, both with full voting rights for all member states. Thus it could settle most issues pertaining to Brexit, the EEA, the EU-Swiss agreements as well as Turkey’s and Ukraine’s full EU candidacies.\n\nOther levels of integration would use existing institutional formats and policies for the EU27 or the Eurozone and would require specification as to the freedoms and obligations deriving from having supplemental common policies.\n\nAs was the case in the US, this re-founding document would spell out the rights and obligations of citizens and member states, thereby clearly defining the case for limited integration for some member states, with the ECJ acting as its guardian.","pitch":"Drafting a Bill of Rights for the European Union clearly defining different levels  of integration."},{"id":150,"readmore":"I refuse to accept that Brexit is inevitable.

The association caters for a potentially high degree of political cooperation in both internal and external security matters, which could involve the participation of Ukrainian police and troops in EU common security and defence policy missions. \n\nClearly, the UK is not quite the Ukraine. The purpose of Ukraine’s association agreement is to promote its emergence as a more modern and Western European state. It helps Ukraine attain standards that approximate to the EU acquis — a task the UK has long since achieved.

That agreement, signed in 1954 between Duncan Sandys and Jean Monnet, promoted cross-Channel trade and secured for the UK a privileged seat at the continental table commanded by the Six. \n\nToday, just because the UK has decided to leave the European club does not mean it has to settle for the role of hanger-on or go into permanent distant exile.

For both sides, it is the best template. \n\nA new European association agreement of the Ukrainian type would rank Britain lower (but cheaper) than Norway, but higher than Canada, more settled than Switzerland and more privileged than Turkey.

Having faced up to a divorce, any form of subsequent cohabitation would be a bad mistake.\nInstead, we should look to our strengths. As a nation, we subscribe to the basic Anglo-Saxon ideal of free trade and free markets, though admittedly all too often we fail to follow it through. This is fundamentally different from the EU approach, which barely tolerates free markets. Our approach concurs with our legal system, which permits all activities, except those specifically proscribed by law. Furthermore, our government and its ministers are also subject to the law.\nIn the EU the Code Napoleon legal system predominates and is fundamentally different, in that government dictates what you can do, and lawmakers are themselves above the law. They are black to our white. Not only do we have a legal system that is more democratic, but importantly it is the system that has been adopted for business around the world, except, of course, where the Code Napoleon rules.\nOur free trade outlook and legal system gives us a head-start in negotiating trade agreements. Negotiations are simple, and we set the rules. We tell our new trade partners they can sell goods into the UK freely, so long as they comply with our product regulations, and we expect the same curtesy to be extended to us. \nThe key to understanding the benefits of free trade is that it benefits consumers, forcing producers to compete instead of lobby. A free trade agreement with China will also bring the whole of the ASEAN trading bloc in under most favoured nation rules. India similarly opens a market to us of over a billion souls.

We should stay in the EU if a good solution to restriction of labour movement ie immigration can be found.","pitch":"If we can fix the immigration issue for all EU countries, then we should vote again to stay in"},{"id":183,"readmore":"Immigration\n\nSummary:\n\n•\tDon’t expect other countries to solve the UK’s immigration problems real or perceived\n•\tFocus on UK policies that intentionally and unintentionally affect inward and outward migration\n•\tNever set net migration targets or frame policies in terms of net migration\n•\tEnsure the concerns of UK residents are well understood whether they are based on real problems or on perceived ones\n•\tEncourage an informed debate.  No politician should be allowed to participate until they have read “Exodus: Immigration and Multiculturalism in the 21st century by Paul Collier” and had their understanding tested\n\nOther Countries\n\nThe EU’s strong attachment to free movement of labour is not just a doctrinal obsession; it is a key part of the EU’s policy objective: raising low incomes to reduce inequality across the Union.  In or out of the EU the UK should not be seen to thwart this objective.\n\nUK Policies\n\nMany policies other than ones labelled as immigration policies can have important effects on the number and nature of immigration.  The government’s decision to raise the minimum wage to a so-called living wage will do more to encourage inward migration than any availability of in work benefits.  Employers pay high minimum wages if they can employ sufficiently productive workers and these have been people from East and Central Europe. Correspondingly the collapse of sterling and the resulting fall in real wages will make working here less attractive and reduce the value of remittances migrants send home.\n\nThe UK’s social policies especially their difference compared with most of the rest of the EU has not been properly addressed.  The UK’s comprehensive income related safety net and its link to job seekers benefit entitlement has presented the UK with greater problems than are faced by other EU countries that do not have a comprehensive income related non-contributory job seekers benefit.  Similarly the way the UK allocate social housing and the links with housing benefit is a cause of resentment and makes it difficult to allocate social housing or pay for private rented accommodation on the basis of residence.  The rest of the EU with greater reliance on contributory benefits avoids the problems the UK has faced.\n\nLarge diasporas increase migration flows and inhibit assimilation.  All policies need to be examined to see if they contribute to the growth of diasporas.  To what extent does social housing policy allow the concentration of migrants and inadvertently lead to the creation of diasporas?\n\nNet Migration\n\nIt is always wrong to draw up policies in net migration terms.  An outflow of 40,000 doctors and an inflow of 40,000 fruit pickers is no policy achievement.\n\nUnderstanding People’s Concerns\n\nDo not dismiss concerns as opinions of racial bigots. Don’t pander to xenophobia by dreaming up policies for firms to list their foreign workers.  Do understand there are real concerns about pressures on schools, on the Health Service and on housing.","pitch":"Intelligent migration policies not xenophobic prejudice"},{"id":184,"readmore":"In 117 AD the Emperor Hadrian came to power and faced the problems of imperial over reach. He reacted by pulling the troops out of Iraq, building a wall in the north of England and setting a limit on expansion.  The EU could well learn some lessons here. There is not only no popular mandate in Europe for \"ever closer union\"  but also no mandate for \"empire without limit in time or space\" to reuse a famous classical line. Europe needs to renounce further expansion and realise that its mid twentieth century vision is badly in need of a pivot to something new. \nThat can only mean \"less Europe\" since there is no democratic support for more.  There are multiple crises now, Brexit, migration,  terrorism,, low growth,  big differences between Eastern Europe and Brussels and the euro crisis may well return.  A combination of variable geometry with the abandonment of expansion might well save the EU.  But it will need a lot of flexibility on the part of the Eurocrats to accept that the traditional four freedoms cannot continue without reform, at least in those countries which are not part of the core. If this works then maybe the rules of the core group could be accepted by more European countries in time.

The medical literature is replete with examples of adverse health impacts from austerity.\n\nWhat I propose therefore, to help guide our economic policy going forward, is a panel of epidemiologists, trained medical doctors specializing in these areas, to assess various major economic proposals going forward in terms of how many premature deaths each policy is likely to cause.\n\nSuch a panel would be non-partisan in nature; it's members could be appointed by the editorial board of The Lancet, the British Medical Journal and the Royal Academy of Surgeons.

The crowd is wild, vengeful and dangerous. The pack is small, focused and ruthless. In pursuing hard Brexit, Theresa May’s government is confusing the needs of the crowd with the interests of the pack.\n\nCanetti’s allegory alluded to the German people (the crowd) and the Nazis (the pack), in seeking to explain the horrors of mid-twentieth century Europe. But the Brexit vote and the Trump candidacy are the same pattern. The pack exploits the justified anger of the crowd. It is important to understand these needs and interests, because May’s obligations must be to the people – the crowd.\n\nWhy are British citizens so enraged? Too many are struggling to make progress. Compare median income with the cost of housing, reflected in house prices. May’s target should be simple enough: to raise median income relative to house prices. Countries that want to raise incomes must invest in education, but they also need to attract capital, skills, knowledge and entrepreneurship. Closing borders and administering shocks to real incomes is the opposite of what should be done.\n\nWhat are the interests of the Brexit pack? Why do they have such hatred for the EU? The answer lies in their dislike of government. The neo-Conservative ideology casts government as the source of everything bad, as in Hayek’s Road to serfdom, and the EU is considered an extra layer of government. This explains why Brexit has emerged politically from the far right, why they claim to love free trade and despise EU bureaucracy.\n\nYet in a globalising world, government is the only solution to the needs of the crowd. The tax burden on median and lower incomes should not be increased, but on higher incomes it must be, in order to fund infrastructure and the services and safety net that is demanded by the crowd. Progressive property taxation, based on the value of assets, not transactions, is required: it should yield a multiple of the amount it currently raises. Private property lying empty should be penalised. There should be no distinction between domestic and foreign in taxation, the same rule for all. House prices must come down, not crashing down, but the balance needs to be restored over time. There must be root and branch reform of taxation to ensure that widespread tax avoidance cannot continue. Why distinguish income and capital gain? Why offer so many tax reliefs? We should have a bonfire of them. Corporate tax can stay low. It is not the issue. Citizens are the issue.\n \nThese are not Conservative policies. But they are not extreme, they follow a Scandinavian model. It is a travesty that the financial crisis of 2007-08 was not recognised as an obvious case of market failure. Instead the debate was captured by a well-organised pack of neo-Conservative thinkers, blaming government for everything. The referendum vote is the result.

Those sober enough forced onto this leaking dodgy dinghy need to make a sharp distinction between human issues, such as immigration, freedom of movement and human rights on the one hand and  economic matters including trade and investment on the other. Within this overall policy approach there would be room for selective immigration to fill skill shortages and welcome investment.

We also should make it clear that Britain will not accept bureaucratic rules and regulations, such as bunches of only three bananas or straight bananas which some Leave politicians were able to ridicule during their campaign.

It is true that Brexit will put a big dent into the very idea of European Union, but the concept is still relevant. The future however will only hold if all principles of the Union will be strengthen, not revoked. And the key in doing that is more economic than political. This is the best way to accommodate all member states and recognise the existing differences which currently are cause for concern.\nWhile the principles of the Union, including the four freedoms are not to be touched, the very political infrastructure of the Union needs a reform. The UK criticism of an opaque and rigid European Administration is not unfounded, therefore the future European Union will need a leaner political administration that will not stand in the way of the business innovation and microeconomic developments. The minimal supranational administration will spur a wider and stronger integration where it really matters: on the microeconomic level.\nThis is because finding a viable economic model which will ensure growth will naturally strengthen the ties inside the Union and heal the existing fractures. This can be accomplished by being opened to the new economy where innovation is mandatory and focusing on the competitive advantages of every participant country and territory. The creation of innovation and technological mega hubs will spur integration of labour resources with flexible capital investments and will prove vital to the quality of this European integration. \nThe first step in doing this is to spur education and bring it up to date in the Union. There is currently a cruel difference in educational quality between the West and the East which in itself is the most important element of future geographical divide. The Union must focus on strengthening educational programs in weaker regions and incite a wider talent search across the Union. \nInnovation and technology is the single most important drive for the future growth and it is linked with a better and wider education. The future European Union must find a way to build mega hubs of technological progress to harvest the best ideas locally and allow businesses to develop new product and services that will strengthen the competitive advantage of the Union on the world markets. Lagging behind those areas is a recipe for disaster, because less competitiveness means less growth and more social and political fractures.\nTo solve the problem of its own integration, the European Union must solve the problems of the world in terms of better products and services. This is a vision that the current Union must embrace and it starts by trimming down the size of the bureaucracy which is a big drain on the budget and redirect the available funds to more productive projects.","pitch":"The future of the European Union will adress world's problems by spurring innovation and technology."},{"id":218,"readmore":"The immigration  issue has been clouded  by the very large number of persons claiming asylum.

Both seem rather remote at first sight, but not impossible.\nThe four questions are based on the assumption that the United Kingdom should ignore all the questions around the referendum and 'respect' the will of the bigger minority; my assumption is that the Government should assume their responsibility, explain why the will expressed in the referendum shouldn't be binding, confront the storm, and apologize.","pitch":"The referendum was an irresponsible decision: a U turn shouldn't be so easily discarded."},{"id":226,"readmore":"Think long-term, and let it be known, that - whatever the current politicians \"in charge\" of negotiations, in Parliament, and others who think they are or should be in charge (including the politicians who call themselves journalists, columnists, newspaper and other media owners, whatever these people may say in the run up and in the course of negotiations, there are many in Britain who do not think that the referendum result is something written in stone, and that it cannot, ever, be undone.

For Brexit to work then what could future UK-EU relations look like?\nPerhaps something new could be tried.  Both sides could borrow a term from the lexicon of Ireland’s former leader, Eamon De Valera, in relation to Ireland and the Commonwealth, and consider a form of External Association.  But what might External Association look like?  The biggest problem seems to be retaining access to the Single Market for the UK, while delimiting Free Movement of people to Britain under Single Market rules.  Perhaps the following would work:\n1.\tThe EU already agrees with the UK that some changes can be introduced:  Restrictions on movement of non-EU nationals; safeguards on bailout contributions from non-Eurozone countries, in the event of crisis; child benefit restrictions for children who do not live in the same EU State as a parent; no binding requirement for the UK to participate in an “ever closer” Union; a requirement to amend proposed EU laws if 55% of national parliaments so request (a Red Card); and an emergency brake on payments of social benefits to immigrants from other EU States if there are strains on public services or the employment market.\n2.\tIn addition to these, and as a way forward, each Member State could be allowed to restrict free movement at times of immigration surges and agreement could be reached that no automatic right would be provided for future new Member State citizens to travel to the UK (or UK citizens to travel to these new Member States).  Each new Member State and Britain could then agree on mutual travel arrangements between their states. \n3.\tThe Acquis Communitaire of the EU is its accumulated legislation, court decisions and principles, all of which the EU, including Britain has already agreed.  The Acquis would continue to apply thereby avoiding years of uncertainty and enormous turbulence.\n4.\tThe national parliaments of EU States already have an early warning system (a Yellow Card).  If one third of the Member State parliaments raise an objection to proposed EU legislation it must be reviewed.  If a majority of parliaments do so (Orange Card) then the Council of Ministers or the European Parliament can vote the proposal down.  The British Parliament could be given continued rights to participate with the Union’s national parliaments in the Yellow/Orange/Red Card system.\n5.\tBritish MEPs would no longer sit in the European Parliament but MPs and peers could enhance their role in EU monitoring at Westminster. Membership of the Council of Ministers and Commission would also cease, but not membership in the European Court of Justice which adjudicates on rules (as rules would continue to apply), and the EU Court of Auditors which checks how the EU budget is spent (as contributions to the Budget, and payments to, for example, British farmers would continue).  In addition, British civil servants could continue, on a quota basis, to service EU institutions to help police the Acquis.\nConclusion\nA form of External Association could be enough to allow Britain cut loose from the EU, but retain necessary and complementary inter-dependence.  Crucially, External Association would not encourage other EU States to contemplate leaving as they would not continue to have EU representation at political level.  Indeed, the remaining EU States could press ahead with “ever closer” Union, including provisions to underpin the Euro.  In the interim a joint EU/UK declaration that External Association is the way forward might calm nerves and remove current uncertainty and speculation.\n\nGay Mitchell is a former Minister for European Affairs at the Department of the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) and at the Department of Foreign Affairs and was an Irish MEP from 2004 – 2014.","pitch":"External Association"},{"id":228,"readmore":"The EU was created on the basis of an agreement between European nations to integrate into a political and economic union. The political component stems from the aftermath of WWII – no more wars between European nations - . The economic component is aimed at facilitating the development of EU member economies and the increase of their citizens living standards. This is achieved through integration into a single market with freedom of circulation for goods, capital, services and citizens. Even though there are a number of important structural aspects requiring changes in the way the EU functions, the fact is the EU nations have been through the longest period of peace and prosperity ever in their history.

In the face of difficult times, the human being natural instinct is to stick together to better fight adversity, be it human or otherwise. Under these circumstances, it would seem therefore normal to increase the level of integration between its members into a stronger EU. In that sense, Brexit runs against this natural instinct.

There are also likely to be investment movements away from the UK into the EU. So the impact on the EU economy is hard to predict.

It is also extremely unlikely that the EU will revisit its commitment to the four freedoms. There will certainly be issues needing addressing like the euro, unemployment, the refugee crisis and so forth, but these will not be affected by Brexit.

London will remain a favoured place for the resolution of commercial disputes.  The legal sector's turnover is tiny compared to the financial sector, and the concerned firms have already made their EU arrangements.\nThe financial sector is the prize.  Between 10% and 20% of London's international financial business is at threat from loss of \"passporting\" rights.  The European financial centres are all capable of building the IT infrastructures in the next 28 months, and plenty of UK, US and indigenous firms are keen to sell them the necessary expertise.  The key people are mobile.  To take 15% of London's financial business is thoroughly feasible.  EU countries have no issue with passporting, nor with time zones.  This is low-hanging fruit.\nTo take this opportunity, the EU has to change nothing.  The existing four freedoms do it all.\nThe opportunity in industrial production\nAs any export salesperson will say, there is no lack of competition.  Companies like Rolls-Royce, with their specific expertise, are very much the exception.  UK exporting firms face new sales problems:  unknown tariffs, increased paperwork (much of it as yet unknown), including new detailed origination documentation, and sheer uncertainty (anathema to purchasing managers handling complex supply chains).  For most EU manufacturing companies, reduced competition from the UK is an opportunity to win orders that, previously, UK companies won, worldwide, not just in the EU.  EU companies can match the quality, and they already have the documentation in place.  The imported inputs to UK manufactured goods mean that the depreciation of the GBP will have only a modest effect on export prices.  When wage inflation kicks in because of cost-of-living inflation caused by GBP depreciation, the longer-term price effect may prove negative.  No changes to the four freedoms are required.  EU companies just have to do what they are already doing, to win business from UK businesses.\nThe opportunity to revisit political constructs\nThe UK decision has warned against EU complacency.  But it also highlighted the need to avoid two-tier structures.  The UK had special treatment – Schengen, working hours directive, etc –but this simply encouraged the UK to ask for more, (the fruitless quest for concessions before the referendum), and then to say \"Good-bye\".  The lesson:  special cases are not the way forward.  Any attempt to create a \"favoured centre\" of countries seeking closer integration will upset the \"outer\" countries, which like the single market, but hold concepts of national \"control\" very dear.  If there is one lesson the EU should take from the UK's decision, it is that closer political integration must wait for considerable years.  Everyone loves the single market, and even the Euro for its simplicity and ease of commercial transactions.  Greeks were so terrified of losing the Euro that they swallowed their national pride in a spectacular volte-face.  The Euro itself implies closer economic integration – which is not the same as political integration.  Learning that the two are quite different is the big \"Thank you\" the EU owes to the UK.\nEuropean leaders have now learnt these lessons at no cost to the EU, nor to their individual countries.

Reform of incentive to migrate to UK\n\na.       IDEA: What is the type of migration that the British are against? Worst possible case is where the migrant’s net contribution to the economy is negative (takes more in benefits and public services than contributes to UK treasury) and when the migrant is socially disruptive in some way (worst case being a criminal). To reduce this type of migration, there should be:\n\ni.      Proof that migrant will be financially self-sufficient when he/she arrives to UK. If it’s a student, then letter of guarantee / money in the bank from parents or relatives. If it’s a job seeker, then evidence of progress with interviewing for a certain position (e.g. successful telephone interviews / video conference with employers). If a family member of migrant / UK citizen, then evidence of sufficient financial support from the family member already in the UK.\n\nii.      No criminal record / if criminal record, then explanation of mitigating circumstances and discretion of Home Office to reject application.

JUSTIFICATION: the newly introduced distinction between British workers and EU workers is no more of an act of discrimination than the currently existing distinction that UK government makes between prospective migrants from outside of EU, whereby for a Tier 2 migrant, the Home Office requests that the job the prospective migrant is applying for “must pay £20,800 or more” (as of October 2016).

Is this failure attributed to the four freedoms of the EU? Perhaps it is. Perhaps the solidarity shown to people fleeing desperate situations of war in Syria through the eastern borders of the EU or the solidarity shown to people fleeing extreme hunger or violation of basic human rights from sub-Saharan Africa through the Southern borders of the EU, was all a big mistake (international humanitarian obligations aside). Or perhaps internal borders should have stopped these people who flee and find refuge in the South or East from making their way up to the North! Those who voted for a 'glorious future' cannot appreciate that in a global community everyone has a share of responsibility towards refugees, and whereas the UK within the EU might have provided open borders which led to immigration from within the EU, now the future closed border system will see the UK meeting its international obligations for granting asylum all on its own (unless the idea is to build a wall of course - fashionable nowadays). \nIn this context, the only fault with the EU is that of not being much more resolute in its vision to continue constructing a united, peaceful, integrated Union. It has a common currency which brings great benefits (jeopardised only by a lack of integrated fiscal policies of the Euro area and a number of opportunistic tax haven practices in certain of its Member States), a common market, EU citizenship, EU law and an incredible cultural and intellectual heritage. The four freedoms guarantee that capital can flow freely to those regions which are most innovative, that every region has access to the largest and richest consumer market in the world, that talent has infinite choices and possibilities in a labour market of over 40 million people, and that no barriers exist for the sharing of knowledge and innovation through an open and accessible network of European universities. \nThe EU should reinforce its commitment to the four freedoms, should enter no special conditions with the UK (if the UK wants to revisit its exit decision nothing is stopping it), should show more leadership in setting a peaceful, ecological and prosperous global agenda, and support all those who share the vision of a united Europe.

That would be hugely beneficial to both sides, UK and the EU.   Conversely, a hard or clean Brexit would be detrimental, politically, economically, culturally to  Europe and the UK as well .And yet it seems that both UK and the EU have become locked in a process that leads inexorably  to a very bloody divorce. This needs to be reversed. \nIt seems to me that finding a solution to avoid a “hard or clean Brexit” may not be so difficult after all , not a herculean task ,  provided that both sides display  a measure  of imaginative thinking and flexibility. What the United Kingdom basically  wants is to “take back control” of its borders by recovering its capacity for   regulating  migratory flows. The EU on the other hand aims at safeguarding the integrity of its system, principles and policies, notably the four freedoms that underpin the internal market (freedom of movement of goods, capital, services and persons). The parallel  overriding objective of the UK is or it should  be to secure unimpeded access to the internal market especially for its vast services sector but also for its industrial exports, without accepting at least in full the free movement of persons. \nHow then this  key  goal , namely access to the internal market can be achieved while restricting  migration but  without violating the four freedoms? The easiest and the legally sound way to do that  is by making a distinction between the “free movement of persons” on the one hand and the “free movement of workers/ labour” on the other as the Treaty itself  actually does. The EU treaty (Treaty of Lisbon) speaks about “the free movement of persons” as an  integral component of the internal market. Free movement of persons involves not only  the free movement of labour but a host of other groups of European citizens (students, pensioners, tourists, businessmen, bankers,  researchers, academics, etc.) with whom UK has hardly had any serious problem of admitting them. So the UK can fully subscribe to the principle of “free movement of persons” as laid down in article 26 of the Treaty (TFEU), as well as to the other three freedoms (goods, capital, services), something which will  go a long way to  meeting  the EU’s  position. \nAs regards labour/ workers, the Treaty contains specific provisions (art. 45-47) which could provide the basis for a fair  compromise to meet British concerns. In particular, the Treaty explicitly says that freedom of movement for workers is subject to limitations justified “on grounds of public policy, public security or public health”.  With a little good will and imagination, this provision could form the basis for working out the sort of arrangements and establishing the mechanism( emergency brake)   that  would enable the UK to claim that “ it has taken back control” of its border and indeed exercise a considerable measure of real control over the flow of workers, migration. For its part the EU can also justifiably claim that the integrity of the internal market has been preserved and the treaty is respected  in full.\nOnce this thorny issue is resolved, the other issues  (payments to the budget, role of the ECJ, etc ) can easily fall into place. It is highly desirable that the UK is also  fully engaged in the common foreign and security policy and to the extent possible to the common defence policy.","pitch":"Make a distinction between freedom of persons and freedom of workers as the basis for a fair comprom"},{"id":252,"readmore":"The EU should just be a customs union of sovereign nations: stick to the economics:forget about the politics and political union.: slim it all down.

To provide this we need to turn our focus inwards (not outwards), toward developing world class education (in all fields, not just science and engineering), apprenticeships, entrepreneurship and infrastructure.  This would be complemented by a system that allows (in a controlled fashion) migrants to the country, wherever they are from, providing they have skills that we don’t currently have for ourselves.  The lack of local thinking by the British political elite, characterised by significant and continuing foreign development contributions to emerging economic giants such as India, could at least in part explain the Brexit result and why populations across so many Western countries are becoming increasingly disillusioned with their own political leaders.","pitch":"We need to focus our attention inwards, to develop a Britain that can trade with the whole world."},{"id":262,"readmore":"Re access to single market for financial services etc.\nHead offices with the brass plaques move to mainland Europe.\n\nWhile the actually activities continue to be located in London .\nThis way EU has a 'political ' victory by claiming that major banks and institutions have  re located  while in essence only ' the brass plaque has moved.

It has proven to be a useful tool to deepen EMU governance during the eurozone crisis. Some policy-makers like Wolfgang Schäuble and Karl Lamers, who coined the term back in 1994, have argued in this newspaper that it will remain indispensable as the EU ventures deeper into contentious areas such as foreign and security policy. A further departure from the ‘community method’ comes, however, with considerable strings attached. Widening dis-congruence between a sub-set of member states and the rest runs the risk of further undermining the legitimacy of the European project. The power balance of the Franco-German axis has, arguably, been tilted in favour of Berlin putting pressure on Germany to form broad-based coalitions to alleviate fears of German hegemony. Under these circumstances, it is not at all clear that more differentiated integration clustered around a eurozone core will be the default mode going forward. In a post-Brexit EU, Denmark will be left as the only country with a formal opt-out from euro membership. In the case of the Schengen agreement, Ireland will be the sole holder of a formal opt-out. This will undoubtedly reinvigorate centripetal forces lowering the overall appetite for more two-speed Europe. Will Central and Eastern European countries that have recently caucused as the Visegrad Group on issues like immigration not increase the demand for the latter? This seems to be an unwarranted concern because most of these countries belong to the largest net recipients of the EU budget and still hold very favorable views of the EU. Even though they might have particularly intense preferences when it comes to certain issues, the current treaties leave a remarkable degree of flexibility to accommodate them. Brexit could thus end variable geometry all together.            \nIn the immediate aftermath of Brexit, European policy-makers have predominantly interpreted the vote as a mandate to prevent a domino effect that could trigger complete dis-integration. A competing frame sees Brexit rather as a warning sign that European integration has gone too far, in particular, on the issue of migration. Which of these two competing views will prevail depends to a large extent on the upcoming election results in France and Germany and on the outcome of the constitutional reform referendum in Italy. Far-right populist parties in all three countries are on the rise lobbying for a repatriation of competences. Revisiting the EU’s commitment to the four freedoms might embolden these parties. In the worst-case scenario, it could set in motion a vicious cycle in which reduced European problem-solving capacity could feed back into more votes for populists, which in turn would put further pressure on governments to ‘de-commit’ from the four freedoms. British domestic politics also matters: the tough rhetoric originating from the Tory Party Convention has angered many in Continental Europe and might even contribute to fostering a common European identity. As the economic costs of Brexit are likely to be smoothed out over time through external devaluation of the pound and with the help of the Bank of England, many European policy-makers might feel that they have no choice but to make Brexit as painful as possible to silence calls for ‘retaking control’ in their own country. An ever closer union seems to be inevitable in a post-Brexit EU.","pitch":"Why Brexit marks the end of variable geometry"},{"id":264,"readmore":"Politicians here and across Europe have dramatically underestimated the incredible magnetic power of the English language in attracting migrants.

Why are people resorting to the courts? \nThis is because the problems are not being addressed and tackled, and conclusions are not being drawn. I know that we all think that, \"It's a difficult problem.\" But it's not that difficult, all the same. But, you do have to swallow and realize that \"Well, we'll have to that then.\" Intellectual and personal honesty is vital, in this regard. Integrity is the watchword for those in power.\nAfter making its mind up, the UK needs to make a proposal to Europe. This stuff about keeping one's cards turned down, is addressing the wrong game. That's what you do in poker but in the great affairs of nations, with a view to achieving something, it is never right to prevaricate, to be negative, to already start negotiations by playing the endgame. Chess players and lawyers need to play out endgames and argue marginal cases, but Prime Ministers need to march forward and lead from the front\nCome on! Make a proposal! I realize that the problem with the proposal is not so much that it will be shot down in Europe. (We can all expect that to happen.) The problem is that it will be shot down at home. Brexit-minded people will find any compromise a betrayal, and export minded-people will be dismayed at a falling-out with Europe. But, analysis of the position, dialogue between opposing viewpoints is essential and in fact that is what is going on. The current proceedings in the courts, for example, is part of that analysis , part of the nation making up its mind\nIn the meantime, it should be promulgated that the rule of law , needs to be honored.

There will be duties and tariffs, and the UK will not be served by rejecting EU standardization, going back, in the future, to the inch and Whitworth thread, for example. This will also not be a recipe for success for trade with Canada and most other countries. \nMy idea is that Theresa should steer towards a soft Brexit. However it is entirely for the UK people and its parliament to choose what they prefer. But my idea is that a Norway-type solution is better than the abyss. Not everything could be achieved that one would wish for, but there would be both co-operation and independence which can be built on and developed in the futureWhichever the UK decides, the responsibility lies with the Prime Minister - to act. She has the initiative. In the great affairs and men and women it is never right to prevaricate, to be negative, to start the game with an endgame. Chess players and lawyers need to play out endgames and marginal cases, but Prime Ministers need to lead from the front.\nThere is a meeting this week with the EU. The EU 27 have already had pre-meetings, where the UK was not present. They have agreed on a common front - with respect to the UK. Many in business, diplomats etc. will know that that is not where you want to be. You need to be at the table where decisions are being made - not in the antechamber.\nIn fact, I would go so far as to say that if Theresa May does not come back with a positive plan, a plan where there is a definite perspective  of agreement, which sounds like being the best thing to do, whatever it is, which she is going to propose to Parliament, for approval, then she should be replaced quickly.\nI realize that this sounds very drastic and precipitive, but this is reality. People in business make this sort of decision every week, some every day. We need to make progress and a solution needs to be arrived at, for the good of the UK.

The \"bound\" duty rates in the WTO require negotiation with other WTO contracting parties and that risks being a long process. And the WTO is not just about duties, so \"WTO rules\" is something that can just be announced.\n\nAs to the withdrawal arrangements prescribed in Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, attention seems to have been fixed on issues inviting demagoguery like the funds needed to finance the pensions of British EU officials, but in actual fact, a large number of issues would need to be settled, issues that are much more important than those pensions. However, even more demanding will be the task of establishing at the national level the regulatory system that hitherto has been in force as part of EU legislation. One of the fantasies entertained by the Brexiters seems to be the belief that that regulatory system can be just shed and that a wonderful freedom then ensues. In reality, much of it is necessary in any advanced society and needs to be maintained more or less as before.

The Norwegian experience where the electorate rejected EU membership but the country enjoys the benefits of the single market, albeit at a cost, is arguably a good example for Britain at this time.\n\nA congenial and positive working relationship with the other 27 members of the EU is a top priority.

A mishandled Brexit could blight the wellbeing of this country for generations.

In my humble opinion, this is very much a counter intuitive position. Over the next few decades, UK will decline drastically in relative importance in the world simply because we are not a populous country, and the rewards of being a first country to achieve modern economic growth after the industrial revolution will no longer be relevant when other poorer and more populous countries catch up, which we all know is inevitable. The only solution ultimately in the long term is by having a large population, which is not going to happen with declining birth rates and restricted immigration…\nMy view might be of the minority, but immigration is not a problem per se in most instances. It is only a problem for politics because it is a perception problem. Classic evidence is when you ask Mr John Smith on the high street how much immigration there is in the UK (absolute number, as a proportion of population, etc.), the answer always end of the to be far higher. Frankly, if a country cannot deal with the level of population growth from immigration as seen in the UK, a country should be ashamed.\nThere may be a case for better communication on this area, abeit unlikely to be effectives. For that, a new government policy on immigration should appear tough and has to be seen as fair, but the outcome should not have much effect in terms of actually restricting overall numbers. It might sound like an insincere proposition but can alleviate a part of the concern regarding fairness, and is one that I think will ultimately address the political perception problem as well as providing the work force needed in the UK.\nI accept that immigrants should not be able to claim benefits for a significant period of time when they first arrive in the UK, but we all know that measures taken in this particular area will not do much except for adding more to the fair element of the new immigration policy.\nThere however should be much clearer and significant provisions in the budget to alleviate resources constraints because of disproportionate increase in population in different parts of the country. Whilst I am aware that another point of consideration is social integration, and I do not have a clear view on what should be done other than that as an immigrant myself, what helped me integrate into this country was ultimately my school, teachers and friends.\nMy position on the pressure on wages of low-skilled labour has always been that there is contrasting economic evidence showing that it is not the case or the opposite is true; even if it is, I believe it is rightly so. No jobs are intrinsically worth anything other than what the market is willing to pay, and government should only intervene where there is market failure in specific instances. Same principle of creative destruction when economic activities become obsolete or worthless over time.\nIn summary, my proposed immigration policy in a post-Brexit world is one that has to be fair, appear tough, and provide the people needed for a tolerant cosmopolitan pot that is of the British economy.","pitch":"Be fair, appear tough, and keep the immigrants coming in"},{"id":274,"readmore":"The Rhondda is once again a beautiful valley, with flora growing over the slag heaps and scars of coal mining.

At that stage perhaps our representatives will rediscover their duty. \n\nFor decades British politicians scored cheap points by representing the EU as “Them against Us”. For decades the Eurosceptic media poured poison on the whole enterprise, damaging the British interest and calling it patriotism. Remainers lost the courage to make the positive case for Europe. \n\nFor all its problems, the EU is the greatest experiment in collaborative democracy in history, established on ground soaked in ancient and recent blood as the nations jockeyed for supremacy. It is a hybrid federal/confederal system which is NOT hurtling towards Superstatehood, to the disappointment of some European visionaries. On the contrary, it is finding a remarkable balance – maintaining the separate governments, identities, traditions, languages, and proud histories of its members, while confronting the dangers of extreme nationalism through democratic institutions that represent common interests.\n\nThe enterprise has been a stunning success, but it is floundering.

In much of Europe though, despite high levels of unemployment, there is a strong sense that quality of life in its broadest sense has not been savaged the way it has been in the UK and a greater feeling of confidence about the future.  \n\nOf the four questions:\n\n1.\tIn terms of the UK’s relationship with the EU, this has been for the most part strongly beneficial and has pushed the UK to accept 21st century policies.  The closest possible future relationship with the EU is essential and continuing membership of the single market appears self-evidently highly desirable for the UK’s economic future, though it is hard to see how this will be achieved at present.\n\n2.\tGoing forward, the UK model does have to change.  Being outward looking and attractive to global foreign investment and influx is important for the UK.  But at the same time that needs to be balanced with greater protection for ordinary people and those outside of London.  Change needs to start at home and a new policy framework is needed to address inequality and to create better industrial and social infrastructures.  Everyone must be supported to contribute to the UK’s economy and wealth.\n\n3.\tImmigration is in many ways yesterday’s issue and the problem has been substantially about how public spending and public policies have failed to respond to the challenges.  Population growth is slowing in Europe.  Britain, with its sunken pound, is already and will be much less attractive to EU immigrants.  Whatever can be done to slow the flow and to accommodate it better within the context of membership of the single market is sensible.  But the reality is that the UK depends on foreign skills and workers in all areas of the economy whether health, agriculture or construction.\n\n4.\tThe future for Britain post Brexit is nightmarish as things currently stand.  Outside of Europe, with a hard Brexit, the UK’s relative decline will accelerate even more rapidly and we will end up a relatively impoverished and lost little island. Britain’s greatest asset has been its global linkages and openness to the world.  A transition to an isolated and bitter little country will put at risk all the things which give the UK its global competitive edge and which fund the country’s current quality of life. This future doesn’t bear thinking about and will see the country lose its best and brightest overseas.\n\nSo, yes, the referendum vote was important and binding.  The messages need to be heeded.  But that doesn’t mean falling in behind the least attractive interpretations of the vote.  It means finding a constructive and creative way through it.  Sadly, Brexit will hurt those most who have been seduced into seeing it as a solution to their concerns. Instead, a new UK needs to emerge.  One which works for all its citizens.  But one which enhances its role as a world player; not one which retreats into small minded isolationism.  The challenge is huge; so too are the stakes.","pitch":"The need to find a constructive and creative way through Brexit that is positive for the people of U"},{"id":281,"readmore":"Almost everybody in the Continent will want Brexit to lead to the closest possible links between The UK and the EU27. The question is not what is desirable, but what is realistically possible. \nForeign policy, defense and security are obvious fields where close cooperation is desirable. It can easily take place within NATO and/or at an intergovernmental level. However, to think that the UK could retain the power to influence the path that the EU27 may want to chose to deal with its own defense, would be unrealistic. The opinion that will matter will be that of the US.\nEconomic matters are clearly the most important, and difficult field; it will be primarily for the UK to decide what it wants. To continue to be part of the Customs Union would make a lot of sense and should not pose to many problems; it would of course limit the ability of the UK to negotiate its own trade deals with third countries.\nAccess to the European Single Market (ESM) is a totally different matter. Given the size and importance of the UK, no existing model may be useful in this case. Three issues will be of overwhelming importance. \nThe UK would be well advised to take seriously what the EU27 stated on June 29th: the four freedoms on which the ESM is based (Goods, services, capital and people) are indivisible. Concerning the free movement of people, some pragmatic adjustments could be found, but of a limited nature; in any event, they will have to include a clear priority for EU citizens in UK's immigration policy. \nEqually, some compromise could be negotiated concerning the UK contribution to the EU budget in exchange for its participation in some programs. \nThe third issue is even more difficult. The ESM is not  a trade deal; it is about market regulation. In this respect there are two non negotiable hurdles. In order to have access the UK will either have to apply EU rules without having the right to participate in the decisions, or negotiate some mechanism, possibly on a sector by sector basis, to establish \"equivalence\". However, in this case access will not be fully guaranteed and the ultimate judge on \"equivalence\" would be the European Court of Justice.\nFinally, the UK will also be well advised to take seriously another sentence in the conclusions of the meeting of June 29th: from now on, the main priority for the EU27 will be their internal cohesion and the future of the block. It will be an extremely difficult and challenging process, that could end up in further integration, disintegration or, more likely, some form of multiple speeds. In any event, it will be a process in which the advise of the UK will neither be welcome nor sought.","pitch":"Please, this time take seriously what the other 27 governments say."},{"id":282,"readmore":"If we wish to build a democratic and prosperous Europe, then the EU must reconcile itself to working with democracy, rather than following its present elitist path. The most urgent problem is represented by the eurozone, where a continuing lack of integration on fiscal matters threatens to result in catastrophic failure. To save itself, the eurozone's initial minimum need is for a central body, controlling its own budget, in charge of banking, debt and finance. Ultimately, the eurozone needs to progressively integrate itself into a United States of Europe, appropriating to itself existing institutions such as the European Commission, Parliament, Central Bank and Court of Justice. To ensure democratic consent, each and every eurozone country would need to conduct simultaneous referendums, with unwilling countries leaving the bloc and re-adopting their own, national currency. Countries which have in the past proved themselves unable to apply the necessary fiscal disciplines, specifically Greece and Cyprus, should be given a generous financial settlement and banned from joining the newly integrated eurozone.\n\nThe obvious problem with this \"democratic\" solution to the eurozone is that it could precipitate the eurozone's demise. The reasoning is that relatively rich countries like Germany and the Netherlands could reject the necessity of subsidising their poorer neighbours that an incipient United Europe would require, and that without the participation of their richer neighbours the commitment of the poorer countries could evaporate. But even such a termination of the eurozone would carry the considerable benefit that the dismantling of the euro could be carried out in a managed manner, rather than occurring as part of an uncontrolled collapse.\n\nThe above scenario outlines how the self defeating stalemate between the European federalists and nationalists can be resolved; either the federalists achieve their aim of a United Europe, at least partially, or their dreams for federalism and the eurozone are extinguished. This new found political clarity will enable Europe to properly appreciate the single market and its customs union, the undoubted jewel in its crown that forms the basis of its present prosperity, and its glue for the future. The \"inner\" eurozone countries and the remaining \"outer\" EU countries would all continue to have unfettered access to the entire existing single market, but for the \"outer\" countries, that is those countries not in the eurozone, the present political constraints would be abolished. So the free movement of people and labour, for example, would be abolished for \"outer\" countries, although these states could, if they wished, re-introduce similar measures between themselves. Similarly, matters such as the abolition of border controls would also be a matter for \"outer\" states to decide directly between themselves, there would be no attempt at EU compulsion. \n\nTherefore the proposal is for a dual tier membership solution for the EU, with countries either in the inner politically integrated eurozone, or in the outer EU single market. Countries in the outer EU single market would be entitled to cooperate politically between themselves in any manner that they chose, as there would be no eurozone or EU involvement in such agreements.","pitch":"Eurozone countries hold referendums for whether to form a United Europe or revert to nation states."},{"id":283,"readmore":"The UK should agree on a Norvegian like relationship before a full Brexit.

This system of welfare states, be it hands-off as in the UK or hands-on as in Sweden, made it the most prosperous continent in the world and it had been said that the liberal, market-based democracy will mark the End of History.\n\nBut the system is eroding and the EU is not doing much about it. Economic growth remains low, unemployment is high in most countries and populism is on the rise. Still the answers from Brussels and the nations’ capitals can be called uninspired at the best. Europe needs a New Deal as a response to the digital revolution but all it has is old news: politicians clinging to their power and their neo-liberal doctrine and a bunch of nationalists trying to answer the 21st century’s question with a mind-set stuck in the 19th.\n\nBritain bravely took the lead on dealing with the industrial revolution so why not do it again 200 years later? Within the EU massive political change was impossible, the consensus on an outdated system is just too big. But outside there is a chance – if you are willing to take it.\n\nSo why not put all the money that has been printed over the last years into new technologies instead of using it to keep run-down banks alive?

This could lead to a reduction of work for everyone and free funds can be allocated to other new projects such as medical research which has been stuck for the recent years.\n\nHowever, such a system would pose certain risks in terms of distribution of welfare. An unconditional basic income would be a solution to let everyone have a share of it.

At the most basic level, the challenges of each city and its citizens are same. Improving the quality of life as experienced and judged through the eyes of its millions of citizens where each voice counts for as much as the other. The challenge comes when one voice or view has a much higher consideration that the other for an extended period. This leads to friction and disengagement amongst the citizens and manifests through what we call the voice of ballots or referendums. In the case of UK from an outsider in perspective, it seems to me that voice & interests of City of London has trumped over every other borough, village and city in UK. This has to change and that is the mandate of people that needs to be respected and acted upon. We may choose to ignore or postpone and then run the risk of another extreme manifestation in the near future. \nThe answer lies not in isolation but in integration. It is not about closing the borders but opening the whole of UK to the opportunities, investment and growth. The economy and interests of City of London should matter as much as the interests of farmers, small businesses, households and immigrants up north. This is not about either but all. The Government of the day has the responsibility to improve the quality of life of all its citizens and residents, not just the few.\nIn this connected world, just as we celebrate the information flow to the Middle Eastern countries and its impact there, we also have to be conscious of information flows to Manchester, Birmingham, Wales, Midlands and Glasgow. The information flow has to be matched by investment flow to improve community infrastructure (roads, bridges, schools, hospitals) and create meaningful employment opportunities for locals. Only when the locals in UK see an improvement in their quality of life as well as a meaningful participation in economic growth & prosperity, they will respond to openness of immigrants in areas where there is shortage of skill. They will then be incentivised automatically to invite and integrate the immigrants in their lives and in the village pubs & the community centers.\nThe open door immigration policy of EU has incentivised people from essentially poorer nations with limited opportunities & infrastructure to come to rich nations like UK and essentially compete for public services with locals. The policy does not give any regard to the impact that this has on the local population or any investment by EU or UK in mitigating the impact of this one-way flow. The unqualified one-way flow is the heart of the problem that can be solved by a two way integrated process where people flow is accompanied by supporting investments to ensure that the locals are not worse off. Each city should have the choice on deciding the immigration flow, with number & type being based on skill shortage and local needs. Further, supplementary investment in community goods has to be done in regions that are seeing the immigration flows to facilitate integration with local population.\nIn summary, we cannot step away from immigration but the answer to it is not a rigid view of complete unrestricted freedom but a managed view grounded in the principles of integration, supporting investment, skill shortage and local choices. This needs to be supported by government actions to invest in regions outside London to facilitate integration and improvement in the quality of life for its citizens. \nAnd when that happens, the local pub in Glasgow will serve Paella and Vodka on its own volition!","pitch":"Managed immigration facilitated by investment in regions to facilitate integration"},{"id":303,"readmore":"My own country, Switzerland, has a long-standing experience with what could be called \"a bespoke arrangement\".

What was lacking in the previous one was a choice about the shape of the future UK.  In the Brexit camp, there was no clear agreement on what Brexit would entail, leading to a vote where many voted under incorrect assumptions. For example, one must doubt that so many would vote for a Brexit that would see significant parts of the banking sector and various foreign manufacturing operations move to continental Europe and yet that would be the consequence of the hard Brexit now in the cards. One would doubt that many would vote for a Brexit where the very union itself is dissolving with Scotland more likely to seek an exit, and yet that could be a consequence as well. One would doubt that many would want a Brexit where residency rights of British expats in Europe would become an issue, and yet they now are.\n\nA new referendum could suggest various avenues forward with people for example being asked to put them in order of best option. Or one where the two top scoring options would be voted on in a second round. These options should be realist, e.g. a halt to immigration will also mean an exit from the common market. Yes I agree, giving people no choice in the nature of the choices isn't very democratic, but that is what referenda do: they reduce complex issues to abstract and somewhat unrealistic options. Those who frame the choice frame the debate and determine the outcome. That's how Brexit came to pass.\n\nSo perhaps then, the UK should not organize another referendum. Perhaps its parliament should ignore the results of the referendum and never trigger article 50.

That process ought to be sufficient for guiding our nation. In this extreme complexity especially, parliament ought to lead.

It gave him an opportunity to think back, on the decisive moments where he had taken decisions which changed not just UK, but the world forever. \nIt started with his decision to join the Brexit campaign.  \nThe problem was that the Fordist industrial revolution, based on mass production, was no longer driving growth. The Thatcher-initiated attempts to prolong growth beyond manufacturing through \"the service economy\", growth of the financial industries in London, as well as more recent attempts, such as credit-based growth and loose monetary policy had just led to widening social differences. One of the drivers behind the Brexit movement was increasing competition between domestic workers and in-migrants, not just on jobs but also on access to welfare benefits, in a situation where labor had a weaker and weaker position. Brexit closed the borders, it created barriers to trade, it destroyed the city, it undermined the position of UK firms in European value chains, it closed science networks between UK universities and companies and universities in Europe, and it sent the Sterling down. \nThis destruction terminated both the strategy of growth created by Thatcher and it blocked the road back to the older growth model of industrial manufacturing, where Germany had the hegemony. The creative part was that it led to a push of capital in the only remaining direction, investments in research and venture capital searching for science and technology super-profits.  The vision driving this new, science based model of growth was new products with superior qualities, produced with superior productivity, generating super-profits to the owners of the new knowledge. The first step was a research alliance between UK and China. The focus was to jointly develop and control the emerging new material and production technologies combining nano-technology, advanced forms of \"printing\", AI, as well as new forms of energy production and use. The emphasis on control of knowledge was based on experiences of recent waves of innovation, where knowledge diffusion efficiently undermined the position of the front runners. Accordingly, the focus on control was guaranteed through an alliance between the Chinese and UK governments. In the framework of this alliance, new technologies were treated as military state secrets. In Britain, the “Lords of Knowledge” constituted a new national elite, closely allied with the state. Their knowledge was crucial to national income, as the new products are efficiently out-competing fordist industrial production on a world wide scale.  The “Lords of Knowledge” took control of the “Upper House”, which gradually came to have hegemony over the “Commons”. \nThe result of this new industrial revolution was mass unemployment and social unrest on a global scale, with two noticeable exceptions, UK and China. In UK, substantial parts of the super profits generated from the new technology are used as a “guaranteed minimum income” to all UK nationals (the Chinese parallel is the recreation of the Mao-style “Iron ball” of rice). In order to make this system sustainable, the definition of “national” was kept narrow, and in-migrants were expelled. They were not needed anyways, because the work force was rapidly dwindling. Soon, 30-40% of the UK population in working age was receiving a minimum income. In return, they gave flexible labor contributions of various kinds, coordinated by computers communicating with their hand held devices. Coordination responded to individual abilities for work as well as needs for tasks to be done identified by local authorities.   A core task for the government is border control, keeping refugees from the European continent out.","pitch":"start and take control of the next industrial revolution"},{"id":316,"readmore":"The elephant in the room with the future of Europe and the Euro is the fact that Germany is getting much richer whilst the Latin Countries are getting poorer.

Is it not in reality a question of where to set the political expediency between the economic necessity of allowing employers to recruit and employ who they feel the need to recruit (whether that is at the skilled or in the unskilled level) and the public perception in many areas of the country that there are too many foreigners – which is itself a very wide ranging and complex perception, and not necessarily linked to the labour market. \nThere are multiple issues that need to be considered and here are three of them\nFirstly, one of the key points is that in terms of net migration, EU nationals only accounts for approximately half in the number of around 300,000 plus per annum: the balance are non EU migrants. Therefore the reality is that Brexit only provides a solution (if that is the perception) for half of that number and the government is in theory in control of the other half. So it is certainly a valid question as to what the government has done and will do in the future about the non EU half.\nSecondly, when Amber Rudd proposed that employers should be shamed into declaring the proportion of foreign nationals they employ, the vast majority of employers would be entitled to question what they were doing wrong. Employers are free to select their employees from any nationality (provided those employees can be legally employed) and if employers in their selection process are preferring foreign nationals there must be a reason for this. On the assumption that most employers will have made a rational decision in selecting who to employ and one of the many criteria they will have considered will have been the nationality of that person it must be relevant to ask as to why foreign nationals have been selected in preference to UK nationals. It may be easier to define the reason in the skilled sector where the skill-set of the individual may be relevant. But in the unskilled sector it may be more difficult to define the reason and an emotive question is whether it is because the foreign nationals are doing jobs which British nationals do not want to do. This may clearly be a politically sensitive question. But if we are going to seek to have a thriving economy post Brexit, we cannot allow it to be constrained by employee shortages in the work place, whether skilled or unskilled \nThirdly, is there a danger (or a reality) that to some extent the immigration issue is in some places in the UK a disguised form of xenophobia. And is this fuelled by a feeling in many places that post-recession the level and quality of social services, including schools, social security and healthcare has deteriorated. The question is whether this is caused solely by spending cuts or by the pressure put on social services by immigrants following the spending cuts. \nThere are no easy answers but party conference soundbites probably aren’t one of them","pitch":"It is a balance between the needs of employers and the perception there are too many foreigners"},{"id":319,"readmore":"“Where on earth are they going to defecate in Britain without a Polish plumber fixing their toilets?” was the first question coming to my mind when the results of the Brexit referendum were announced.

The question of yes or no, in or out are silly questions of narrow minded individuals indulging in the seclusion of a tell tale fantasy called merry old England. \nHey folks, wake up, you – and not only in the City – are already most international, most globalised, most tolerant and above all most sophisticated in integrating foreign cultures. What I admire most about London is how friendly and considerate you are in getting along with each other, even when the tight space in the Tube makes it hard breathing. There is so much respect and responsibility, we in Munich can only dream of. You manage to integrate myriads of cultures into your British feeling. The Empire and the Commonwealth have left their traces for good. You are such a bold nation, so open-minded and tolerant. Thence, I shatter at some remarks of certain politicians. Why on earth are they so afraid? Where has gone your confidence? I strongly believe that the British nation can be neither overpowered nor diluted.\nThere is no doubt that foreign workers are needed, not only the plumber or cucumber picker but also foreign experts in all kinds of trades, especially in high-end technologies, be it engineering, software or banking. Less qualified migrants find their nukes and corners for business in the service sector, from rye bread deliveries to manicure. Britain should not close down the shutters to them as they do forward the British economy. They are producers as well as customers. The problem is rather how to direct and canalise these streams of various people with very different backgrounds flowing in.  \nWell that is a problem you British have much more experience in tackling than anyone else in Europe. The key is a solid economy, promising welfare to everyone struggling had – be they English or not. In an economy booming, immigrants are most welcome, but in an economy on the decline, immigrants are considered a threat, supposedly taking other peoples jobs and social allowances. Ay, there is the rub – prosperity. Hence, the most urgent issue is to establish a boom economy. With interest rates on the decline and capital anxiously kept tight, the task is enormous, but there is no other way. \nThe pulse of globalisation cannot be underestimated. The more people the more demand, which is just one segment of possible effects. The more qualified experts the more innovation. The more graduates the more start-ups. The more diversity the more different ideas. The more influx the more output.\nI am a Munich Keynesian living in the slightly impoverished areas of Northern Germany. Thus, I pretty much understand the problem of the gap between London and the periphery e.g. Sheffield and the City, but all I know is that economic prosperity and social security are conveying integrity and identity of the in-group and tolerance for the coming-in. Thus, the most urgent issue is to stimulate the economy by investment. I am sure all the migrants, be they from inside or outside of Europe, are a blessing in disguise: They confront us with our own deficiency of not being able to create equal opportunities to our own nationals.","pitch":"Migraton is the heartbeat of globalisation; it reveals our own  deficiencies."},{"id":320,"readmore":"The United Kingdom's 2016 EU referendum was socially divisive, and consequently the country needs reconciliation. Ten of the UK's regions - Wales and the nine English regions outside London - each saw a majority of votes cast in favour of leaving the EU, as did the country as a whole; but a hard Brexit would put Northern Ireland's peace at risk, would harm London's prosperity and cosmopolitan vibrancy, and would move Scotland towards full independence. Those three regions each had a majority for remaining in the EU.\n \nThese seemingly incompatible regional agendas can be reconciled if the Ten leave the EU, while the Three remain within it; and whereas a full Brexit would meet the call of the 37% of the electorate who voted Leave, and an unchanged relationship with the EU would satisfy the 35% who voted Remain, this partial withdrawal gives more of the electorate what they said they wanted: together the Remain voters in the Three and the Leave voters in the Ten represent 41% of the electorate.\n \nThe withdrawal of the Ten from the EU will require a managed border between Scotland and England; and a new border between Greater London and the rest of England. Scotland’s increased autonomy will reconcile three movements: for continued Scottish membership of the UK, for continued membership of the EU, and for greater Scottish self-determination. This is not the end of the United Kingdom; indeed, it is the best chance to preserve its unity, just as Greenland sits outside the EU, but within the united Danish Realm.\n \nTo protect London's viability and vitality, the newly-autonomous region will encompass the Thames east of this city and out to the English Channel, including the London Gateway docks. During the period of negotiations and border construction, London will build many new homes to accommodate a higher proportion of its workers; this period will give time for some Brexiteers who live in the Three to move to the Ten; and for some Remainers who live in the Ten to move to the Three. Even after those relocations, there will continue to be daily commuter flows across the borders. Just as Greenlanders are EU citizens, citizens of the Ten would remain EU citizens, making commuting into the Three straightforward. This is feasible and realistic: it's already a reality for Switzerland, which has a daily intake of a quarter of a million commuters from its EU neighbours.\n \nThis solution also protects two pillars of the Northern Ireland peace process: firstly, the existing soft border between the North and the Republic of Ireland can continue as it is now; and secondly the further devolution of powers from the UK government to the regional assemblies of the Three Remainers will allow Northern Ireland to remain subscribed to the European Convention on Human Rights, even if the Ten Leavers choose to withdraw from it.\n \nThe Leave voters of the Ten get their desired freedom to revise their immigration rules without being bound to EU freedom of movement; and to negotiate trade deals around the world, unshackled from the requirement of London's financial services’ EU passporting. Just as Greenland did, the Ten will negotiate partial access to the European market shaped around their present economic needs.\n \nAnd if, in the future, citizens in the Ten or the Three wish to change their minds once the consequences of Brexit become more apparent, then this division of the Ten and the Three would be more easily reversible than a full Brexit would be.

Equally, the UK cannot turn its back to the very same migration that since the Bronze Age has created these treasured islands that many of us ('native' and of imported vintage) cherish and wish to preserve.\n \nHowever, as one commentator for this newspaper has already alluded, we are living in 'Bizarro' times and this is not limited to fringe parties with insignificant political clout. Lord Hill recently and correctly commented on a BBC interview that the EU was built on romantic ideals of unity. Although, Lord Hill was stating the obvious, it seems that many have forgotten (some conveniently through the last four decades of the UK's membership of the EU) that the EU Treaties are built on ever closer union. Equally, Europeans who argue that the UK needs to face the consequences or abide by paying and accepting all the rules of the club (regardless of how unpalatable the membership conditions are), sound more convincing as a racketeering organisation rather than a political and economic block built on the ideals of ending all wars and violence.\n \nThis is the setting in which we must consider what is the best outcome in each case for the UK's departure from the EU and the future of Europe. In neither case is it possible to think that Christmas will come early and the UK and Europe will go in opposite directions singing Kumbaya. The best possible realistic result for the UK and Europe is that the concept of subsidiarity embedded in the EU Treaties will finally be given some teeth by hard-coding (within the EU's structure) the limits of the EU’s supranational decision-making.\n \nAlthough, seemingly much maligned, the idea proposed by Bruegel of a 'continental partnership' is a step in that direction. Arguably, the concept of ever closer union can be seen as an evolutionary limb just as much as subsidiarity is a mutant gene waiting for the right time to gain momentum. Both concepts of ever closer union and subsidiarity can co-exist in a dynamic evolutionary cycle.\n \nEvolutionary cycles are not alien to the European Parliament and the European Commission and in fact both institutions have thrived on the back of incremental political and economic changes in Europe in the last three decades. The trick now is for policymakers to find the trigger for Europe to change in a way that harnesses Europe's evolutionary gene. Contrarians may argue that the now very probable failure of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement may provide the impetus needed to reform the European institutions to permit a new relation with the UK that is both agreeable and realistic.

If the UK's economic circumstances were to deteriorate, and Brexit voters were left poorer and disadvantaged, such voters would not feel magnanimous in 'defeat'. Instead, it would usher in an era of even more extreme post-fact politics, and we should be wary of the damage this would do to future generations. The government needs to prioritise the economy for this reason. The UK should end the 100,000 migration target with immediate effect - there is no science or research behind it. Similarly, the UK Tier 2 visa caps should be removed. Furthermore, the UK should have a flexible visa relationship with the EU - any job offer means that you can come to the UK. The UK should then enter into an EEA style agreement, to keep Single Market access. Soft power will be damaged, but at least the currency depreciation and potential economic impact of Brexit will be mitigated.

In short - we need more democracy, not less; but we need to do it better and more deeply - by improving the quality of the conversation about our economy with our citizens. Had we moved away from the bipartisan, polarised and populist representations of the UK's national economic future which we saw, towards an economic debate that engages citizens in the many trade-offs implicit in economic decisions (a classic example is the trade-off between access to the single market, and freedom of movement) through more deliberation, informed dialogue and discussion, we might have seen a better quality of discussion and debate about the EU.

We will do this in close collaboration with economists, politicians, policymakers and civil society - using Athenian style models of discussion and dialogue to democratise and reinvigorate economics so that it is closer to citizens. Our key contention is that, for the UK economy to arrive at its best possible model - a model that works for, and is inclusive of everyone - it must take measures to engage as broad a cross-section of society in the vision for the UK's national economic future, listening to their thoughts and perspectives early and upstream.

The contribution-based benefit systems of countries such as Germany have a similar effect, limiting the eligibility of newly arrived EU migrants to claim benefits in a way that does not discriminate based on nationality.\r\n \r\nI propose that a similar approach can be applied to the UK minimum wage.

There is so much respect and consideration, we in Munich can only dream of. You have managed to integrate myriads of cultures into your British feeling.

Thus, the most urgent issue is to stimulate the economy through investment.

The ID card is irrespective of nationality – it does not replace your passport – it does however help the Authorities in so many ways to keep the Country as secure as it can be and to support the right of every person here to earn a living, be paid properly, and to control movement in and out of the Country.\nTo live and work in the country is linked to the Employer of the ExPat. If the status of employment’ changes and there is no longer work available for that person – given due notice – it is fair that the ExPat returns to their home country.\nOn the other hand, if the ExPat stands up and demonstrates self-motivation and entrepreneurial spirit they can set up and operate as an SME or business that then reflects on their ID status.\nThe cost to establish and implement cards will be high, but the cost of policing and managing civil unrest would be high too.\nWe need talented, hard-working immigrants to support the UK economy and we should welcome them, with the right controls and a humanitarian ethos.  We also need to regenerate motivation and pride within British Society to work on all tasks in the workplace and be sensibly compensated. That way we stand a chance of maintaining a balanced and self-sustaining population for future generations over the decades to come.","pitch":"National ID cards would be the foundation of immigration control."},{"id":344,"readmore":"All but a small and manageable proportion of immigrants offer skills and determination to succeed. if an Afghanistani refugee has managed to cross continents and survived sea crossings to arrive at our shores, then they have shown a determination that needs our attention.

Europe's voiceless tremors do not reach her. Europe is apart and England is not of her flesh and body. But Europe is solid with herself. British preoccupations must largely fall away and...must be haunted by other and more dreadful specters.\" John Maynard Keynes Cambridge 1919. Almost one hundred years ago Keynes saw the dangers of England's detachment from Europe. He was right twenty years later, could he be right again?\nThere is not a board member I interact with today who fails to see the dangers of  Britain's pending detachment from \"the mainland\". In the forty two years since accession the country has had an ambivalent relationship with the largest market on our doorstep. Despite the exceptional compromises which Margrit Thatcher engineered for the country, those of my generation seem not to have come to terms with Britain's place in the world post Empire.\nFrom my first introduction to economic geography lessons at undergraduate level there has never been any academic work that argued against free access to large markets nor to the value of free trade. Increasingly the apotheosis of free trade is being challenged by the isolationists and insularity of those who believe we can go it alone. It may take another forty years to feel the real impact of Brexit but feel it we will.\nIn 1919 Britain accounted for more than one third of world trade. Today that number is less than five percent. Admittedly it is a much larger market but that is now dominated by the emergence of China and The Far East. The country's future lies in the closest of ties to Europe, we cannot move to Asia. Rebuilding trading relationships depends on growth in manufacturing but that is now a fraction of what it was a hundred years ago. The country thrives on intellectual capital and experience. Much better to be selling those services to five hundred million people than relying on convincing those in distant parts that they should work with us in our isolated islands.\n\nHow the Prime Minister squares the circle to ensure we have that access while controlling immigration is the conundrum of our times.

Companies stopped training  in 2004 preferring to import skills because it was cheaper, Brexit gives us a great opportunity to start training again.","pitch":"A fair way of controlling immigration without increasing pressure on services"},{"id":347,"readmore":"Sell off Ireland Scotland and Wales to the highest bidders.

Financial services is largely a nonsense industry - raiding whatever pockets of public money. And so much of it is speculative and unproductive - and ultimately its profit is at the cost of ordinary folks. Britain needs an economy that serves real human needs. Mazlows' hierarchy offers an interesting framework for identifying products and services that work for people sustainably.  Survival needs: Food, energy and shelter - revitalise agriculture (in the holistic method) and  housing (sustainable design) with sustainable energy production. Security: Essential insurance etc. Kinship: Products and services for social engagement and connectivity such as churches, sport activities, cultural activities. Self-esteem: Products and services that enhance a genuine sense of self-worth, such as on-going education opportunities, arts and cultural activities. Especially assist the creation a sustainable industry of private health and wellness enhancement. Self actualisation: We need an economy that unlocks human creativity and value creation. Collaborative networks that identify and enable productive capacity at local levels can bring additional meaning to human lives. The focus of such an economic model would be genuine human flourishing rather than short term exploitation of opportunity aimed at profiteering.","pitch":"Unlock human creativity in the interest of genuine human flourishing - an ethical model for Britain"},{"id":349,"readmore":"If the Brexit vote tells us anything, it is surely this: that despite being ‘the fifth largest economy’ in raw GDP terms, many people do not feel prosperous.\n\nBritain has preferred to paper over the cracks of widening inequality and social unease in recent decades by hiding behind ostensibly high output-per-capita statistics inflated by City salaries. Now, the simmering volcano of resentment has exploded in the most spectacular fashion. \n\nWhile details remain nebulous, hard Brexiteers routinely argue that only by leaving the single market and customs union can Britain slash the dreaded ‘Brussels red tape’ and strike trade agreements with everywhere from Australia to Zambia, transforming us into some sort of giant Singapore.\n\nWhat this means in practice, of course, is hard to pin down. But the only logical interpretation is a more deregulated economy, with workers’ rights and protections such as the Working Time Directive and paid parental leave scrapped or curtailed, combined with free trade deals and subsidy removal leaving key sectors at the mercy of competition from lower-wage economies globally. With London’s financial sector already being wooed by continental suitors, drastic cuts to corporation tax have also been mooted to keep highly mobile sectors domiciled here.\n\nMany hard Brexiteers will regard this package as the bitter medicine the UK economy must swallow in order to thrive. \n\nInevitably, however, it is those who have lost out from globalisation who will be the losers in this scenario – the low-skilled, low-wage workers who were also statistically far more likely to vote leave.\n\nFor a start, we will have to kiss goodbye to European structural fund investment - worth £1.8bn per year and funnelled into the post-industrial cities in the North of England and the Welsh valleys. But that is dwarfed by the loss of European Investment Bank (EIB) money for infrastructure projects, which has totalled £5.6billion in the past year alone.\n\nAnd a cut to business taxes will inevitably hurt the public finances and, by implication, services such as the NHS and education.\n\nMoney alone, however, doesn’t explain the UK’s vast disparities in prosperity. A startling recent report from the Legatum Institute found just 34 of the UK’s 138 urban areas are delivering notably more prosperity than their wealth would suggest. \n\nQuality of life measures – factors such as health, education level and a sense of opportunity within reach – provide a fuller picture of whether a local area is delivering a “prosperity surplus”. \n\nAnd while our urban areas are the drivers of our economy, nine out of 10 UK cities (57 out of 63) perform below the European city average on productivity, dragged down by low skills and a high proportion of poorly-paid services jobs.\n\nSo post-Brexit, Britain stands at a crossroads: we can either go further down the road of a low-skill, low-wage, more insecure ‘gig’ economy. Or we can invest in the drivers of social mobility and sustainable growth based around high-value sectors.\n\nInternational comparisons show that the most prosperous countries are those that put their money where their mouth is when it comes to these foundations of wellbeing. Norway – regularly at the top of international league tables – spends 7.4% of GDP on education, compared to our 4.3%.\n\nAnd while Theresa May has talked of a newfound interest in “industrial strategy”, this needs funding. Often derided by free trade zealots as “protectionism”, this is what successful manufacturing economies would call “normal”. Take Germany – its export-led economy didn’t spring up overnight. It’s the conscious product of decades of public-private collaborations on applied R&D to support innovation and a dual model of vocational education to sustain a highly trained workforce.\n\nTo truly thrive outside the EU, Britain must avoid a slash and burn approach that will further entrench the divisions that led us here.","pitch":"The UK must get serious about tackling the prosperity gap that gave us Brexit"},{"id":350,"readmore":"Brexit Will Unite Europe\nFar from bemoaning Britain’s decision to exit the European Union (EU), the other Member States will come to celebrate it.  Brexit will unify Europe around a more competitive economic approach.\nAmongst the range of arguments made for Britain’s withdrawal was the idea that the EU was a quagmire of regulation and practices that impact on its competitive position.  Businesses, in particular, were suffering in the global context from environmental, labour and other laws.  The City meanwhile was under threat from new taxes and regulations that would destroy its global position whilst allowing Paris and Frankfurt to ‘catch up’.\nQuite which laws and regulations Britain will lose is not yet clear.  Details will follow once the promised ‘Great Repeal Act’ has been passed although this mass switch of EU laws into UK laws is now being criticised.\nLittle attention has yet been paid to what the EU will look like once Britain has unpicked itself but this is the opportunity that many European politicians have been looking to focus on enhancing economic growth and delivering on business needs.  They will have a common ‘enemy’ in Britain to help them focus on that.  \nFar from the suggestions many here have made, there is a history and purpose behind the EU that the Member States and its electorates buy into.  There will always be sections of the populations looking to breakaway but they are far from mass movements.  \nThere will be a unity of purpose in focusing on ensuring that Britain does not ‘win’ from its Brexit decision that will outweigh tendencies towards further disintegration.\nBrexit will allow Europe to focus on its strengths rather than just thinking about how to bind people into the project.  Those strengths are not just about single market integration but are also about being able to deal with the challenges of modern economies, such as urbanisation.  The ‘liveability’ of cities, air quality, interconnections between people, life / work balance are all issues that are gaining electoral credence.  They are also critical for businesses looking to attract and retain a knowledgeable, skilled and creative workforce.\nThe UK will be solely focused on its economy and securing trade deals.  Indeed, the best opportunity for Europe is if Britain goes down a glorified ‘off-shoring’ route.  The proposed changes to corporation tax could be just the first of a series of ‘relaxations’.  Businesses may celebrate but it is not clear that is what the electorate wants.  State and social interventions still retain a high degree of support.  Just think about the battle bus commitment to NHS spending if you doubt this for a moment.\nThe approach advocated by the ‘Great Repeal Act’ approach is to extend business risk indefinitely.  Party manifesto after party manifesto will pick a piece of former EU legislation to revoke so change could be continuous for a very low period of time.  The EU can capitalise on this.\nThe EU will not go down an exclusively UK/US style of capitalism but will retain a more European system of social protections and worker engagement.  But that is what electorates and consumers want.  The reputation of companies they people do business with is increasingly important, the race to the bottom does not look very attractive.\nSo Brexit can bring together electorates and politicians across Member States.

Brexit can be a positive signal for a new alternative for Europe as a whole. A Europe based on the rule of law, democracy and liberty that makes new, bold and pioneering ideas, embraces this century and overcomes the tragedy of the last.\n\nHowever we have responded to globalisation by making our decisions with little democratic consent. As instantaneous mass communication emerges, the perception that EU institutions are too distant from the people they represent leaves them unfit to solve Europe’s economic and political problems. Today we are seeing a hard-headed reaction to the rapid process of ever closer union.\n\nWith populations continuing to rise, the EU ideal for Europe that was conceived following the catastrophe of the Second World War has proven to be a flawed model. Border fences in some EU member states have been erected since the Cold War era while south of the continent, there has been a period of high unemployment and sustained economic stagnation.\n\nThe lack of democratic accountability in the EU’s executive and economic branches of government in the form of the European Commission and the European Central Bank has led to Europe’s current political instability. We have already witnessed Syriza’s rise in Greece and next year Frauke Petry’s Alternative fur Deutschland may cause the unravelling of Angela Merkel’s grip on power. In France, the Netherlands and Austria, nationalism is surging. In eastern Europe, Poland’s Law and Justice Party and Hungary’s national conservatism have undermined the core objective of the EU’s project. How did we allow this to happen? \n\nThe EU’s concentration of power while remaining unaccountable to the voices of citizens means legitimate concerns towards globalisation are paid little attention. Far from securing a European consensus, the EU has left us in a state of malaise. In the aftermath of Brexit, the EU has to think carefully about where it goes next.\n\nThere is an opportunity to create a new narrative for Europe as a whole. The flawed model that the EU created for Europe after the Second World War has to adapt in order to tackle the challenges of this century and to survive further into the future. Although perhaps, instead of a project that concentrates legislative power at the centre, a project could be created that helps to develop national democracy by putting power back into the hands of the people of Europe’s nation-states. Given Europe's imperial history, it may be difficult at first to respect the wishes of individual countries. However, in light of the increase in cross-border relationships, an improved Westphalian model of balance of power is possible to achieve. By giving citizens the chance to shape their country’s political development rather than an elite, the fruits of globalisation could be better perceived and obtained. After all, the principle that those who hold power should be held accountable to those who place them there in the first place has been central to our political advancement. From relishing rather than tempering the opportunities of the 21st century, a Europe can be built that respects the people’s decisions while adhering to the rule of law. It is a new way for Europe to overcome the tragedy of its recent past.","pitch":"Brexit is the first step towards building a new narrative for Europe."}]
